Apple unveils waterproof iPhone 7 with dual cameras

Apple is out to make a splash with new waterproof iPhones, a smartphone game starring Nintendo's beloved Mario" and a push on wireless headphones.The iPhone 7 and larger iPhone 7 Plus, with sophisticated camera technology, improved water resistance and other features, were shown off to applause on Wednesday at an Apple event in San Francisco.
The flagship devices with boosted memory capacity will be sold at roughly the same price as the models they replace, starting at $649 for the iPhone 7 for US customers, with deliveries in 25 countries beginning September 16.Revered Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was a surprise guest at the Apple event, unveiling a new Super Mario Run" game heading for the iPhone by the year-end holidays.
We want as many people of all ages to be able to play Super Mario Run," Miyamoto said.We plan to release it at a set price, and then you can play to your heart's content.
" The price was not disclosed.Apple, Nintendo and game maker Niantic used the event toannouncethe wildly popular Pokemon Go would be available for Apple Watch users later this month.
Pokemon Go has beendownloadedmore than 500 million times and billions of kilometers have been walked by players since it was made available free in early July, according to Niantic Labs, which created the game.NOHEADPHONE JACKA new iPhone feature which may ruffle some feathers is the removal of the headphone jack, requiring audio to be delivered via Apple's proprietary lightning" connector or by wireless.
Lightning connectors were designed from the outset to handle high-quality audio, Apple vice president Phil Schiller told the audience, addressing concerns about the jack removal.It comes down to one reason: courage, the courage to move on," Schiller said of the decision to get rid of the traditional headset port.
Our smartphones are packed with technologies and we all want more, and it is all fighting for space in that same enclosure. Maintaining an old, single-purpose connector just doesn't make sense.
"Apple AirPods" wireless ear pieces and adaptors to plug old-fashioned wired headsets into Lightning ports will come with iPhone 7 models, according to SchillerThe 35mm analogue jack for wired headsets dates back more than a century, and it was time for someone to break from the past and start pushing people into the future," Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said after the event.Apple may be setting the stage for a dramatically different iPhone model to debut next year on the10th anniversaryof the smartphone first introduced in 2007, Bajarin reasoned.
It could be a first step for Apple making this completely wireless, and maybe next year a new iPhone with wireless charging," the analyst said.GETTING WETThe new-generation iPhones and Apple Watch boast the ability to get wet without getting ruined.
The first Apple Watch was splash-proof, the Apple Watch Series 2 is swim-proof," Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said during the presentation.The new smartphones come with Apple seeking to reverse declines in sales of the iPhone in an increasingly saturated global market, and boost its Apple Watch.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the new smartphones take advantage of the latest iPhone software, iOS 10.We are about to launch iOS 10, our biggest iOS release ever It is jam-packed with new features," Cook said.
Now of course the world's most advanced mobile operating system deserves the most advanced smartphone, and here it is."The iPhone 7 Plus, Apple's version of a phablet," includes dual cameras to improve optical performance and photo quality.
While Apple has touted total iPhone sales of one billion, the number sold in the quarter ending June 25 fell 15 percent from a year earlier, highlighting concerns over growth for the key profit driverAnalysts were split on whether new iPhones would help Apple regain momentumI believe Apple did enough to keep the base happy with upgrades and arguably did enough to attract some Android users," said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy.The iPhone 7 is a completely new phone.
"But Neil Saunders of the research firm Conlumino said the iPhone 7 is not radically different to the previous incarnation." and that the new features are unlikely to be persuasive factors in determining whether consumers upgrade or stick with what they have.
"Bajarin believed the iPhone 7 models would encourage upgrades and stabilise iPhone sales growth.MOVING FORWARD ON WATCHOn the wearables front, its new Apple Watch Series 2 will also feature GPS and allowing people to gather fitness data during an outdoor workout without need to take along a smartphone.
We started shipping Apple Watch just 18 months ago, and already people all over the world are using it in many aspects of their daily lives," Cook said.Sales figures for the smartwatch are not disclosed by Apple, but surveys show enthusiasm has faded since last year's release.
Apple saw a 56.7 percent year-over-year drop in sales of the device in the past quarter, research firm IDC said.
Apple has rethought the Apple Watch significantly since its first release," said Jackdaw Research chief analyst ja Dawson.It's original emphasis on apps and communication has faded into the background as health and fitness features have come to the fore.

APPLE UNVEILS WATERPROOF, WIRELESS IPHONE 7 WITH DUAL LENS CAMERA
Nigerian Tribune
September 7, 2016 Wednesday


Copyright 2016 African Newspapers of Nigeria Limited All Rights Reserved
Length: 469 words
Body


 After months of anticipation, Apple has finally revealed the iPhone 7 and a new version of its Apple Watch.
The new iPhone 7 will controversially dump the headphone socket in favour of the lightning port and wireless headphones, and boasts longer batter life.
The larger iPhone 7 plus also has a new dual lens camera system, and Apple also unveiled new $159 Airpod wireless headphones - although said it will ship an adapter for older headphones along with lightning headphones in every box.
Tim Cook opened the presentation at the the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco with a video of him taking part in a carpool karaoke with James Corden, singing along to One Republic before they were joined by Pharrell to give Cook some fashion advice.
'I'm so glad James got me here on time, I may have lost my voice,' he said, before revealed new episodes of the show will debut on iTunes next year.
In a rare slip, Apple accidentally unveiled the device itself with a tweet minutes before the unveiling - before deleting it seconds later.
'The iPhone has become truly a cultural phenomenon,' Cook said.
'We've now sold over a billion of them.
'This makes it the best selling product of its kind in the history of the world.'
'It's the best iPhone we have ever created - this is iPhone 7,' said Cook.
'It makes all the things you do every day better.'
It will cost the same as the iPhone 6s, and be available in new larger capacities.
Apple's Jony Ive revealed the handset's new aluminium design, before Phil Schiller explained its features.
It comes with a new high gloss 'jet black' colour and 'invisible' antenna lines.
There is also a second black colour, and Schiller joked 'we call it - black.'
It features a newly designed home button which is now customisable and has a new force feedback feature.
It is also now water and dust resistant.
'Even the clumsiest of us don't have to worry.'
New stereo speakers have also been added to the handset - but the headphone socket has gone.
'We are moving to lightning,' Schiller said.
'We are including lightning earpods in the box.'
Apple will also include an adapter in the box to alow users with existing headphones to carry on using them.
Apple justified the removal of the jack as a courageous move to ditch a 100-year-old technology and make more space inside the iPhone.
It offered as alternatives a lightning cable earphone and an adapter for the old type, but touted new wireless earphones.
'It makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices,' said Phil Schiller, senior VP of worldwide marketing, announcing the launch of AirPods, Apple's own wireless earbuds using the firm's new wireless W1 chip, and costing $159.
'We're just at the beginning of a truly wireless future we've been working towards for many years,' added chief design officer Jonathan Ive.

Apple unveils water-resistant iPhone 7 and new watch - Are you getting one?

APPLE has unveiled the new iPhone 7, having made the phone water resistant for the first time and removed the headphone jack.
The tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook announced the phone at an event in San Francisco, though a social media glitch saw the firm's Twitter account - only recently activated - accidentally reveal the news early.
A new version of the Apple Watch, called the Series 2 and with greater focus on health and exercise tracking, was also announced, including a special Nike+ version for runners.
The Watch, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go on sale on September 16, with pre-orders for the devices beginning on Friday.
Instead of the traditional headphone connection, iPhone packages will now come with earphones that fit into the phone's Lighting port, currently used for charging and data transfer.
However, Apple also revealed new wireless earphones, called AirPods, that will connect to both iPhone and Apple Watch remotely.
An adaptor that enables traditional headphones to continue to plug into the iPhone will also be included in the box.
The iPhone 7 has also had its camera completely redesigned, with a much-rumoured second lens being added to the larger iPhone 7 Plus that will enable users to capture more zoomed images without losing picture quality.
The lenses across the two phones now contain a 12 megapixel sensor.
Mr Cook said of the smartphone: "It has become the industry gold standard.
"iPhone is the phone by which all others are measured and it has become a cultural phenomenon."
In July, the tech giant revealed it had sold the one billionth unit of the device, while Mr Cook said the Apple Watch was now the world's second most popular watch brand and most popular smartwatch.

A new version of the Apple Watch, called the Series 2 and with greater focus on health and exercise tracking, was also announced, including a special Nike+ version for runners.
The Watch, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go on sale on September 16, with pre-orders for the devices beginning on Friday.
Instead of the traditional headphone connection, iPhone packages will now come with earphones that fit into the phone's Lighting port, currently used for charging and data transfer.
However, Apple also revealed new wireless earphones, called AirPods, that will connect to both iPhone and Apple Watch remotely.
An adaptor that enables traditional headphones to continue to plug into the iPhone will also be included in the box.
The iPhone 7 has also had its camera completely redesigned, with a much-rumoured second lens being added to the larger iPhone 7 Plus that will enable users to capture more zoomed images without losing picture quality.
The lenses across the two phones now contain a 12 megapixel sensor.
Mr Cook said of the smartphone: "It has become the industry gold standard.
"iPhone is the phone by which all others are measured and it has become a cultural phenomenon."
In July, the tech giant revealed it had sold the one billionth unit of the device, while Mr Cook said the Apple Watch was now the world's second most popular watch brand and most popular smartwatch.

Firstly, for all those of you who have been waiting patiently (or not so patiently) for the newest iPhone, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are finally here. "While expectation had been low heading into the event, excitement appears to be quickly growing and we believe this could be the most significant upgrade in the phone's history", the brokerage firm Stifel said in a note to investors on Apple.
Other smartphone makers are also having trouble dazzling consumers with new advances. The bestperformance andbatterylife ever in an iPhone. It's waterproof, 50% faster with a brighterdisplay and a built-in Global Positioning System. Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. And it looks every bit as powerful as it is.
Apple Inc will not release first-weekend sales of its new iPhone 7, the company said on Thursday, making it harder for analysts to get a read on the product's prospects amid questions over whether its popularity has peaked. It's coupled with a new image processing chip and quad-LED flash that produces 50 percent more light.
One of the more interesting aspects of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is the elimination of the headphone jack in the smartphones. He says Apple is "baking that into the price" with its phone prices in Canada.
The AirPods are said to get about five hours on a single charge, which might keep you entertained on a cross-country flight, but it won't do for a flight, say, to Mumbai.
In the United Kingdom, theiPhone 7 starts at £599 for the 32GB, while the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus starts at £719. But Apple has never been shy about marketing its products at a premium price. The page also claims putting your iPhone in the dock can help you "enjoy clearaudio during speakerphone calls".
How do you charge your phone while listening to headphones that will now be connected via the Lightning connector? Apple has dropped the talk-time from 24 hours on 3G on the iPhone 6S Plus to 21 hours on the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple says in its iPhone comparison section on its website. TheiPhone 7 will maintain the same pricing tiers (starting at $649 for the 7 and $769 for the 7 Plus), but with more space: Apple has doubled thestorage in each of the models, finally dropping its much-criticized 16GBstorage option.
And yes, it does come in Black!

That was lower than the 61.1 million the company sold the same time last year, though it is in line with the 51 million analysts expected Apple to sell in the three months ended in March.

Bet on black: new iPhone delivers under the hood; Muted response to the similar design fails to appreciate engineering innovations, say experts

When Steve Jobs introduced the original iPhone in January 2007, he touted the device as "a revolutionary and magical product" that was "five years ahead of any ­mobile phone".
But the latest iterations of ­Apple's flagship product, the ­iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, were launched last week in the United States to muted reception since the basic design retained that of the previous two generations.
Once they have it in their hands, they will fall in love with itJulie Ask, a vice-president at Forrester Research
"Consumers underestimate the engineering feats the iPhone 7 brings, like the audio, camera and processing power, in such a small package," said Julie Ask, a vice-president at Forrester Research. "While it's hard to market performance and speed, consumers need to experience it firsthand to get it. Once they have it in their hands, they will fall in love with it."
The Posthad a limited hands-on time with a test unit, but it certainly left a very good impression.
Available in Hong Kong from Friday, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have three storage capacity options - 32 gigabytes, 128GB and 256GB - and come in five case finishes: silver, gold, rose gold, matte black and jet black.
The jet black iPhone 7 is likely to be the must-have model, ­despite the constant fingermarks users will inevitably have to wipe from its piano lacquer-like finish. This high-gloss aluminium case draws attention, much like the white iPhone 4 model when it was released in 2011.
The jet black model is available only with the 128GB and 256GB storage options.
Audio is greatly enhanced by two new stereo speakers, which deliver twice the volume of the iPhone 6s
That seamless unibody design also parlays a re-engineered enclosure that makes the iPhone 7 both water and dust resistant, as well as competitive with premium water-resistant Android smartphones like the Galaxy S7 from Samsung, and Sony's Experia Z5.
The 138-gram new iPhone model's 4.7-inch Retina HD ­display - the branding used by Apple for its high-definition - multi-touch screens, has 1,334 by 750-pixel resolution, which makes it up to 25 per cent brighter than the iPhone 6s.
Pre-launch concerns focused on the removal of the stereo jack, which means the phones only work with compatible wireless headphones, such as the new AirPods available separately from next month. But audio is greatly enhanced by the handset's two new stereo speakers, which deliver twice the volume of the iPhone 6s.
The iPhone 7 sports a 12-megapixel back camera and a 7MP front camera, while the 7 Plus has a 12MP dual camera at the back. Both models come with an optical image stabilisation feature for better low-light photos and videos. The technology ­compensates for handshake and counteracts motion blur.
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available from Friday and prices for the iPhone 7 start from HK$5,588, while those of the 7 Plus start at HK$6,588.

Boycotting foreign products has little to do with patriotism

People should not boycott foreign products, because that has little to do with patriotism.
The Apple iPhone7 and AirPods are displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, US, September 7, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]
"TO ANY EMPLOYEE who buys an iPhone 7, come and quit your job." An open letter written by the owner of a company in Central China's Henan province to his employees has gone almost viral online. The administrative department of the company has confirmed the letter's authenticity, saying those who buy iPhones are "unpatriotic". A comment in Beijing Youth Daily questions the logic:
When the news first became public, many viewed it as a joke, although some irrational netizens said "no patriotic Chinese should buy an iPhone 7; they should buy Huawei instead".
Buying a foreign product does not make a person unpatriotic. And since China and the United States are interdependent economies and most iPhones are made in China, boycotting them will hurt Chinese industries and workers.
Some "patriots" might have their own economic theory and insist on boycotting products from the US and Japan. They have the right to not buy some foreign products. But the problem arises when somebody compels others to accept his/her views and act (or not act) accordingly, and threatens to fire them from their jobs.
That becomes a legal problem. By threatening to dismiss employees who buy iPhone 7, the employer has violated their rights of free consumption and the labor law.
The judiciary should intervene, instead of allowing him to go scot-free because he hides behind the cover of "patriotism". And there are others who believe in his skewed logic. Yet what such people propagate is not true patriotism.
Some of them boycott Japanese products by smashing Japanese cars purchased by their compatriots; a few even attack, both verbally and physically, those using Japanese brands.
By using violence against their compatriots, they also hurt the industrial chain in China. Since many brands already have a global presence and Chinese workers work for them, boycotting their products will hurt the latter.
Therefore, people should not boycott foreign products, because that has little to do with patriotism.

Cord-cutter: What the iPhone 7 looks like, and when you can get it

 Apple has unveiled the new iPhone 7, having made the phone water resistant for the first time and removed the headphone jack.
The tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook announced the phone at an event in San Francisco, though a social media glitch saw the firm's Twitter account - only recently activated - accidentally reveal the news early.
A new version of the Apple Watch, called the Series 2 and with greater focus on health and exercise tracking, was also announced, including a special Nike+ version for runners.
The Watch, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go on sale on September 16, with pre-orders for the devices beginning on Friday.
Instead of the traditional headphone connection, iPhone packages will now come with earphones that fit into the phone's Lighting port, currently used for charging and data transfer.
However, Apple also revealed new wireless earphones, called AirPods, that will connect to both iPhone and Apple Watch remotely.
An adaptor that enables traditional headphones to continue to plug into the iPhone will also be included in the box.
The iPhone 7 has also had its camera completely redesigned, with a much-rumoured second lens being added to the larger iPhone 7 Plus that will enable users to capture more zoomed images without losing picture quality.
The lenses across the two phones now contain a 12 megapixel sensor.
Mr Cook said of the smartphone: "It has become the industry gold standard.
"iPhone is the phone by which all others are measured and it has become a cultural phenomenon."
The features of the iPhone 7 split the technology industry, impressing some, but leaving others feeling underwhelmed.
Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight said that Apple had arguably exceeded expectations with the 7 and 7 Plus.
"In the context of a smartphone market that is firmly in an innovation drought, there's a strong argument that the iPhone 7 is more than an iterative update," he said.
"Upgrades are all important to Apple and for consumers coming from an iPhone 5s or iPhone 6, the iPhone 7 will feel like a considerable step up."
However, smartphones expert Ernest Doku from comparison site uSwitch said the iPhone 7 would fail to grab the attention of many.
"Despite being touted as a credible numbered sequel, it was difficult to escape the feeling that the iPhone 7 is very much an iterative device rather than the step change needed to allay concerns of falling fortunes," he said.
"Having said that, the device nailed the key features consumers look for in a flagship smartphone, from an improved display and increased resilience to water and dust, to an improved camera and better battery life.
"Only time will tell if this is the model to help Apple to break away from Samsung, who is aggressively biting at their heels with a strong line-up in the Galaxy S7 and Edge."
The controversial decision to remove the headphone jack from the two iPhones could also prove pivotal to the iPhone 7, it was claimed.
"The removal of the headphone jack will be the spark for widespread innovation in accessories and a meaningful revenue opportunity for Apple," Mr Blaber said, also praising the news that the 7 is water and dust resistant for the first time.
"Twelve months from now, the removal of the headphone jack will be viewed as an Apple masterstroke," he added.
"iPhones have had a poor reputation when it comes to accidental drops and water damage.
"The IP67 rating on the iPhone 7 will be welcome news for careless owners and will doubtless hurt some of the numerous repair shops that have appeared on every high street."

Critics torn over latest iPhone

Year after year, Apple releases a new version of the iPhone that is slightly faster, faintly more attractive and a bit more functional. And these little changes usually get consumers going crazy.
Since its release in 2007, the iPhone has become the most popular cell phone on the market and has dominated all of its competitors. According to CNN, more than 42 percent of U.S. smartphones are iPhones and 55.3 percent of smartphone users in New Jersey own iPhones.
The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have finally been unveiled by Apple and for millions of hype-driven fans, the wait is finally over. The new phone was released on Friday, Sept. 16 and according to Apple, the iPhone 7 is the best iPhone ever made.
The new iPhone features a brighter screen, pressure-sensitive home button, water-resistant body, longer battery life, additional camera lens for clearer photos, better speakers and a faster processor. The iPhone has also removed its headphone jack and introduced wireless headphones.
Since Apple maintains such high brand loyalty, many consumers will not even consider the competition when shopping for a new smartphone.
"I have always thought Apple has a cleaner layout than other phones and, in my opinion, iPhones are more user-friendly," said Molly Mullee, a junior health and exercise science major who has been on "team iPhone" for years.
On the other hand, many critics have stated that since the death of Apple innovator, Steve Jobs, in 2011, Apple has failed to come up with new and creative ideas.
"Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design," The New York Times wrote. "Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones."
According to Gabriella Cardoso, a junior elementary education major and iPhone user, Apple products have not changed much in terms of design over the last few years.
"The iPhone 7 is basically the same as the iPhone 6," Cardoso said.
The iPhone 6 was released in 2014, meaning Apple had two years to come up with something creative. But it seems as if the same product with just a few additional features is being marketed again.
In a 107-second advertisement video entitled "Don't Blink," Apple summarizes the major updates of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2 and AirPods. The company implies in the video that its choice to remove a 100-year-old headphone jack shouldn't be a "shocker" to customers because Apple is supposed to be all about innovation, right?
But it seems many customers are not happy about the lack of a headphone jack.
"Getting rid of the headphone jack is just another way to make consumers spend more money on Apple products," Cardoso said. According to her, Apple has shifted its focus from giving consumers what they want to developing products that make the most money.
Michaela Curtis, a junior elementary education major and current iPhone user, agreed.
"The new wireless headphones that come with the iPhone clearly look like they're going to fall out all the time and Apple is going to expect everyone to shell out money for a new pair when they lose them," Curtis said.
Many consumers are asking if Apple's lack of innovation catch up with them in upcoming sales. As of now, Apple still dominates the market and has been the best for nearly 10 years. But maybe it is time for a new company to emerge.

Ear of the beholder; Apple unveils new iPhones, sans headphone jack

Highlight: Apple's next generation of smartwatches will include GPS tracking and enough water resistance to swim with in an attempt to spur more sales in the iPhone's newest product line
Body


SAN FRANCISCO — Apple’s latest iPhone may be more notable for what’s missing than what’s been added, as the consumer tech giant tries to revive demand for its top-selling product and nudge consumers closer to its vision of a wireless world.
That’s a world where, in Apple’s view, consumers will use the same wireless ear buds to shift seamlessly from listening to music on their iPhone to talking with their Apple Watch and other gadgets made by the California tech giant.
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus unveiled Wednesday come with a faster processor, longer battery life and better cameras — including a new dual lens system in the pricier 7 Plus model that provides higher quality zooming. But the new phones won’t have the analog headphone jack that’s been a staple for decades in just about every consumer electronics device that can play audio.
Apple is betting its legions of loyal fans will embrace the shift to digital headsets that use wireless connections. Or — if they insist on sticking with their old ways — that they won’t mind using a new style of earbuds that plug into the iPhone’s “Lightning” charging port.
CUTTING THE CORD
The redesigned earbuds — with cord — will be included with the new iPhones. Also in the box: an adapter that will let older headphones plug into the digital charging port. But Apple would clearly prefer to push consumers to make the leap into what it envisions as a “wireless future.”
“The reason to move on is courage,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, who spoke during the company’s fall product event. “The courage to move on and do something new that will benefit all of us.”
As part of the transition, Apple also is introducing wireless “AirPods” that will sell for $160. They’re powered by an Apple-designed processor and special software that Schiller said will let users easily sync the wireless buds to their iPhone, Apple Watch and other Apple devices. Apple is also promising a new line of high-end wireless speakers from its Beats division.
Getting rid of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack helped Apple make room for a second iPhone speaker designed for playing stereo sound. The iPhone 7 is also water resistant, a popular feature that rivals such as Samsung Electronics have already introduced in some phones.
Schiller portrayed the move to drop the headphone jack as a step toward improving user experience. “It makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices,” he said during the company’s annual fall event.
APPLE’S CHALLENGE
The company is trying to reverse its first decline in iPhone sales since the company’s late founder, Steve Jobs, unveiled the trendsetting device in 2007. It’s also seen a drop in demand for the Apple Watch since its introduction last year.
While the company sold nearly 92 million iPhones in the first six months of this year, that’s about 15 percent fewer than the same period last year. Industry analysts say the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which Apple introduced last fall, didn’t offer many compelling new features over the previous year’s models.
OTHER UPGRADES
The new iPhones will debut Sept. 16 in the U.S., China and more than two dozen other countries. Orders will start this Friday.
Older iPhones will also see improvements this fall as the company releases its latest mobile operating system version, called iOS 10. It will be available as a free download beginning Sept. 13. Among other things, the software will add more intelligence to Apple services like Maps, Photos, the iPhone keyboard and Siri, the voice-activated digital assistant.
The company also used Wednesday’s showcase to introduce a new generation of its smartwatches, which will include GPS tracking and enough water resistance to swim with. 
Apple is increasingly promoting the watches as tools for health and fitness enthusiasts.
The Apple Watch will get a popular new app later this year too. Niantic Labs, the maker of the cultural sensation Pokemon Go, announced Tuesday that the game will be released for the watch, building upon the apps it already has designed for the iPhone and Android devices.
Apple shares gained less than 1 percent in trading Wednesday, before closing at $108.36. The stock is slightly below its value a year ago, when the last iPhone came out.

E-COMMERCE; Trademark protection lands Etsy seller in hot water

Ryan Ma's business operation is so small that he has been handaddressing all the envelopes he bought at Wal-Mart to send his product to customers. But in the age of online commerce, it was still big enough to attract the ire of Procter & Gamble Co.
Mr. Ma had been noticing the criticism of Apple Inc.'s new wireless ear buds - called AirPods - which will likely be a growing product in the new year, as Apple's new phones come without a headphone jack. Among the criticisms were that the small, untethered buds would be easy to lose or steal, with some noting that their case looks like a packet of dental floss. Mr. Ma decided that making them actually look like dental floss might be a theft deterrent.
So on Sunday, he designed a sticker to place on the packet to do just that, and put it up for sale on Etsy. The idea quickly received coverage on news websites such as Gizmodo.com.
"It kind of blew up from there," he said.
The problem was that he had used real designs as his inspiration, and the sticker looked a lot like P&G's Oral-B brand of dental floss, called Glide. Mr. Ma's sticker listed "Oral O" and "Glides" as its brand names, and borrowed the blue-and-white colouring and font style of P&G's labels.
On Wednesday, Mr. Ma received a message from Etsy saying that his listing had been deactivated following a trademark infringement notice from "Procter & Gamble Business Services Canada Company."
"I freaked out a bit," Mr. Ma said. He revamped the sticker and renamed it "Flossy," and reposted the listing. (P&G did not reply to a request for comment.)
"I didn't think it would take off, it was just sort of a joke," Mr. Ma said, explaining that he had only ordered 250 stickers printed.
The case raises an interesting question about trademark protection. It does not actually matter that the purpose here was not to use the brand to undercut P&G and sell floss, or that Mr. Ma's fledgling business is tiny - the fact that the label was clearly based on P&G's design would be enough to raise concerns.
"This happens every day," said Eric Macramalla, a partner at Gowling WLG in Ottawa who focuses on intellectual property law. "If trademark owners don't protect their trademarks, then the strength of your trademark gets diluted ... and ultimately, they may altogether lose the ability to effectively enforce their rights against other parties. So while big brand owners may be seen as the bad guy when they go after the little guy, it is important that they do so."

IT'S something that I've dubbed the grandmother moment. A time when the latest wi-fi gadget simply baffles us and we fall off the fast moving cyber train.
There's no doubt that as we get older the quest to embrace new technology becomes more challenging.
The workplace, banking, shopping, travelling, entertaining, communicating, socialising and organising our homes are now mostly dominated by wireless communication.
The mobile phone, in all its guises, is like a fifth limb without which modern life would be impossible.
If you want to know something about an electronic device ask a 12-year-old, to whom such knowledge seems second nature.
Toddlers barely out of nappies will serenely slide their fingers across a screen as if it was a reflex action genetically inherited.
For us baby boomers there will at some point be an electronic hurdle that we deem simply too high to jump and we'll abandon the race. 
Which brings me to the grandmother analogy. Born in the 1880s, my grandma was puzzled by her first exposure to television in the 1950s. She assumed that the TV presenters were addressing her directly and would talk back to them. She couldn't comprehend the technology.
We were at Manchester Airport heading to the USA a couple of weeks ago. 
Overloaded with suitcases and cabin bags and with passports, visas and barcodes to be scanned, we were asked to provide the address of our first night's stay in the States, which we did.
"What's the zip code," asked the check-in agent.
Not sure off the top of my head," said I.
"I need to know. Google it," she impatiently instructed.
It could have been a John Cleese moment. What if I didn't have a phone? What should I do, offer to invade Poland?
My other half was already onto it and calmly researched the information.
Google it, scan it, Skype me, Whatsapp me, new verbs, new nouns, new ways of living.
Science will continue to challenge our perceptions. I was struck in New York - and I'm sure it's the same in big metropolitan areas worldwide - by the number of people on the "sidewalks" holding animated conversations apparently with themselves. It's a strange social development. You're in a crowd and talking loudly but not to anyone nearby, rather a cellphone buddy somewhere else in the country.
Apparently Apple's latest device does away with the headphone socket. 
Their wireless earphones, called Airpods, will take over, the conversations channelled through the phone's lightning conductor. 
Grandma, I can empathise. The simpliciity of your world certainly had its attractions.
READERS know where I stand on the GTFC stadium.
The club needs a new ground if it is to progress. 
The Parkway is the only feasible site. The associated developments help finance the stadium. 
No brownfield site has that option. If a fairy godmother were to suddenly appear and find, make suitable and finance another site then so be it, but in the real world if it doesn't happen on the Parkway it won't happen anywhere, not in the near or medium term.
The community in general is behind it, so is the council.
Some local residents are against it, for various reasons, and they are entitled to have their say. 
There are clearly issues of access and traffic that need to be addressed, but it seems that the main beef about this specific development is the impact of noisy fans on those paying their respects in the Crematorium gardens. 
Yet for three summer months there will be no football crowds, the rest of the year there will be fans there for just two or three hours once a fortnight, and sometimes these games will be at night in the depths of winter. 
To say this will make life unbearable for mourners is stretching credulity.
And it is naive to believe that if the stadium doesn't go ahead then the land, which is far from a bucolic paradise anyway, will remain untouched.
There will ultimately be development, housing or retail, as surely as night follows day. 
A community sports complex, part funded by new homes, may be the least worst option for those opposed to urbanisation.

Forget about saving the world, Apple, and focus on battery life everlasting

In the 1930s, an Israeli psychiatrist identified a peculiar malady he called Jerusalem syndrome. Previously normal people would arrive at the Holy City and be seized by messianic zeal. Looking at many American tech companies today, it's hard not to diagnose something similar going on in their boardrooms. For some, it's not enough to boast of running a successful business. Their mission is nothing less than to change the world.
Symptoms of Silicon Valley syndrome were clearly on show at last week's iPhone 7 launch. Over two interminable hours, a series of senior Apple executives stood up in a 7,000-seat auditorium in San Francisco to announce updates to the iPhone and Apple Watch with all the majesty and gravity of Moses delivering the stone tablets.
The event began with Tim Cook, the chief executive, taking part in James Corden's viral hit Carpool Karaoke, singing along to Sweet Home Alabama. It ended with a performance by the singer-songwriter Sia, dressed like a less tasteful Grayson Perry. This featured a pile of lifeless dancers in leotards, presumably a visual metaphor for the state of my iPhone battery by 5pm.
In between, human adults clapped at wonders such as the promise of a free software update coming later this year. When the applause got particularly frenzied, Cook steepled his hands into a "namaste" pose and inclined his head graciously. The atmosphere reminded me of a Moonie mass wedding or a Jeremy Corbyn rally.
All the way through the live stream, I caught myself thinking: you don't get dishwasher manufacturers carrying on like this, do you? Imagine it: a reverent hush as the boss of Zanussi announces a minor improvement to the drain hose; thunderous applause at the news the cutlery bit will have room for twice as many forks. Yet the tech industry is suffused with the belief that it is moulding www.humanity.No wonder obeying national laws or paying taxes feels such an imposition.
At one point, within five minutes there were three references to changing the world. At another, we were invited to look at a picture of a Chinese yak farm and marvel at Apple's commitment to renewable energy (never mind that it's a company making shortlived gizmos stuffed full of rare earth metals).
The highlight was when Philip Schiller, senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, announced the rationale behind dropping the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7. Until now, the 3.5mm jack has been a universal industry standard: one pair of headphones worked with everything from oldfashioned record players to new www.PCs.No longer. The new iPhone's headphones will plug into the same rectangular socket as the charging cable. To use both at once, or to use normal 3.5mm headphones, you'll need an adaptor.
This is either (depending on your generosity) a necessary innovation to free up space inside the phone for a better camera, or a cynical attempt to lock customers into buying Apple's own-brand headphones. Even the former explanation was not epic enough for Schiller, though.
"Some people have asked why we would remove the analogue headphone jack from the iPhone," he told the crowd. "It really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on, do something new, that betters all of us."
Doesn't that bring a tear to your eye? Pack up your polio vaccine, lads. Cancel the space programme. Put a sock in it, Malala. Here is the true triumph of the human spirit.
What's worse is that there is no need for this sort of pomposity. Beneath the po-faced pageantry, Apple is a clever, successful, innovative company. It challenged the dominance of Microsoft when that behemoth sorely needed a competitor.
With the iPad, it invented an entirely new genre of device - a gadget no one knew they wanted. And if you've ever seen a toddler tapping furiously and fruitlessly at an old-fashioned television, you'll appreciate how quickly its touchscreen technology has become indispensable in our daily lives.
In the past decade, however, Apple has gone from an easy company to love to a hard one to like. It has become the Keith Vaz of tech firms: so insufferable that many would cheer its downfall.
The fault lies with a Silicon Valley ideology that insists on "disruption" as its highest goal. Not only must traditional industries be disrupted - as Uber claims to have done with taxis, and Airbnb with hotels - but companies must continually reinvent themselves.
In Annie Hall, Woody Allen describes a relationship as being like a shark: it has to move forward or it dies. That's also how tech companies think about themselves. It doesn't matter that Apple is sitting on cash reserves of more than $200bn ((EURO)178bn). Any company that makes only minor improvements to excellent existing products might as well give up, according to the dominant mode of thinking.
And so Apple knew it could not just announce the thoughtful tweaks it has made to the iPhone camera - even though these are a key selling point. Instead, it had to unveil "AirPods" - wireless headphones that have been unkindly compared to a tampon without a string.
Their battery lasts five hours and only a brave soul would shove them into a bag or a pocket; instead they must nestle in a special protective case, which doubles as a charger. Oh, and they cost $159. That's the price of disruption for you.
Personally, none of this innovation impresses as much as an iPhone battery that regularly lasts past 5pm would. If only Apple could give me that, I'd happily sit through all the pictures of yak farms and interpretative dance its executives could throw at me. Saviours of Silicon Valley, take note.

Has Apple made a splash or a dive with new waterproof iPhones?

(AFP) Apple is out to make a splash with new waterproof iPhones, a smartphone game starring Nintendo's beloved "Mario" and a push on wireless headphones.
The iPhone 7 and larger iPhone 7 Plus, with sophisticated camera technology, improved water resistance and other features, were shown off to applause on Wednesday at an Apple event in San Francisco.
The flagship devices with boosted memory capacity will be sold at roughly the same price as the models they replace, starting at $649 for the iPhone 7 for US customers, with deliveries in 25 countries beginning September 16.
Revered Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was a surprise guest at the Apple event, unveiling a new "Super Mario Run" game heading for theiPhone by the year-end holidays.
"We want as many people of all ages to be able to play Super Mario Run," Miyamoto said.
"We plan to release it at a set price, and then you can play to your heart's content." The price was not disclosed.
Apple, Nintendo and game maker Niantic used the event to announce the wildly popular Pokemon Go would be available for Apple Watch users later this month.
Pokemon Go has been downloaded more than 500 million times and billions of kilometers have been walked by players since it was made available free in early July, according to Niantic Labs, which created the game.
No headphone jacks
A new iPhone feature which may ruffle some feathers is the removal of the headphone jack, requiring audio to be delivered via Apple's proprietary "lightning" connector or by wireless.
Lightning connectors were designed from the outset to handle high-quality audio, Apple vice president Phil Schiller told the audience, addressing concerns about the jack removal.
"It comes down to one reason: courage, the courage to move on," Schiller said of the decision to get rid of the traditional headset port.
"Our smartphones are packed with technologies and we all want more, and it is all fighting for space in that same enclosure. Maintaining an old, single-purpose connector just doesn't make sense."
Apple "AirPods" wireless ear pieces and adaptors to plug old-fashioned wired headsets into Lightning ports will come with iPhone 7 models, according to Schiller.
The 3.5mm analogue jack for wired headsets dates back more than a century, and it was time for someone to "break from the past and start pushing people into the future," Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said after the event. 

However many believe this is not an argument and that sound quality and convenience of interchangeable wired headsets seems to have taken a back seat for Apple. The move has also been criticised as a market dominance ploy.
Apple may be setting the stage for a dramatically different iPhone model to debut next year on the 10th anniversary of the smartphone first introduced in 2007, Bajarin reasoned.
"It could be a first step for Apple making this completely wireless, and maybe next year a new iPhone with wireless charging," the analyst said.
Getting wet
The new-generation iPhones and Apple Watch boast the ability to get wet without getting ruined.
"The first Apple Watch was splash-proof, the Apple Watch Series 2 is swim-proof," Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said during the presentation.
The new smartphones come with Apple seeking to reverse declines in sales of the iPhone in an increasingly saturated global market, and boost its Apple Watch.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the new smartphones take advantage of the latest iPhone software, iOS 10.
"We are about to launch iOS 10, our biggest iOS release ever. It is jam-packed with new features," Cook said.
"Now of course the world's most advanced mobile operating system deserves the most advanced smartphone, and here it is."
The iPhone 7 Plus, Apple's version of a "phablet," includes dual cameras to improve optical performance and photo quality.
The iPhone 7 is a completely new phone  
While Apple has touted total iPhone sales of one billion, the number sold in the quarter ending June 25 fell 15 percent from a year earlier, highlighting concerns over growth for the key profit driver.
Analysts were split on whether new iPhones would help Apple regain momentum.
"I believe Apple did enough to keep the base happy with upgrades and arguably did enough to attract some Android users," said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.
"The iPhone 7 is a completely new phone."
But Neil Saunders of the research firm Conlumino said the iPhone 7 "is not radically different to the previous incarnation." and that the new features "are unlikely to be persuasive factors in determining whether consumers upgrade or stick with what they have."
Bajarin believed the iPhone 7 models would encourage upgrades and stabilizeiPhone sales growth.
Moving forward on watch
On the wearables front, its new Apple Watch Series 2 will also feature GPS -- allowing people to gather fitness data during an outdoor workout without need to take along a smartphone.
"We started shipping Apple Watch just 18 months ago, and already people all over the world are using it in many aspects of their daily lives," Cook said.
Sales figures for the smartwatch are not disclosed by Apple, but surveys show enthusiasm has faded since last year's release.
Apple saw a 56.7 percent year-over-year drop in sales of the device in the past quarter, research firm IDC said.
"Apple has rethought the Apple Watch significantly since its first release," said Jackdaw Research chief analyst ja Dawson.
"It's original emphasis on apps and communication has faded into the background as health and fitness features have come to the fore."

Here's how much 'Australia Tax' you'll pay on the new iPhone

Australians will pay significantly more for Apple's new iPhones than American customers, even without the effects of the GST and the weakened Aussie dollar. But the so-called "Australia Tax" on the new gadgets is only half what Apple applies to music downloads.The six new phones, announced on Thursday and available to order from today, range in price from $1079 to $1569 depending on storage capacity and size. Comparing those prices, minus the 10 per cent GST, with pre-sales tax US prices converted to Australian dollars reveals Apple is charging Australian customers between 12 and 15 per cent more than Americans. 
The cheapest of the new iPhones is $132 more expensive in Australia, based on current exchange rates, and the top-end model is $159 dearer.The cheapest models have the largest price disparity, with the entry-level 32 gigabyte iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus about 15 per cent more expensive in Australia than the US.That tapers down to around 14 per cent for the 128 gigabyte models and about 12 per cent for the 256 gigabyte models. The new Apple Watches also come with a variety of price premiums. The basic aluminium-case model, advertised at $529, is $50 more expensive in Australia once GST and the exchange rate are stripped out, while a deluxe $1029 stainless steel model is only $22 more expensive.AirPods, Apple's new wireless headphones, are identically priced once GST and the exchange rate are factored in.While Australians have long complained of being gouged by an "Australia Tax", which sees them pay significantly more for tech products than Americans, technology commentator Stephen Fenech said the new iPhone prices were fair. "It's to be expected that we pay a little bit more, because apart from GST there's other tariffs we pay and they've got to ship them from different places," the Tech Guide editor said. Mr Fenech said the premium on iPhones was insignificant compared to massive mark-ups on software and digital downloads. Even Apple applies more "Australia Tax" to music downloads on iTunes than on its iPhones. Beyonc??'s track Hold Up, for example, is $US1.29 ($1.69) for American iTunes customers but $2.19 for Australians - a 29 per cent difference.The tech industry has previously defended its local pricing by arguing the cost of doing business is higher in Australia because of federal and state taxes, wages, tariffs, importation and transport costs. Fairfax Media has previously revealed Apple paid just $85 million in income tax on the $8 billion in revenue it made in Australia last year. Apple was contacted but declined to comment on how it formulates its Australian pricing.

Here's how to make your iPhone 7 charge wirelessly and increase its battery life

The iPhone 7 India launch is just around the corner and as you already know, there are a couple of missing features even in this latest and greatest phone.
ADDING WIRELESS CHARGING
We had hoped that Apple would add wireless charging to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus but there are some options if you want to add it yourself.
You can get a wireless charging adapter like Aircharge (Rs 1,790 on www.mobilefun.com) that connects to your phones lightning port and allows you to charge using any Qi charging base. The other option is to get a wireless charging case — these are only available for iPhone 6s and 6 Plus now, though you should be able to get one from brands like Spigen soon.

NON-EXPANDABLE STORAGE
Apple has increased the base storage from 16 to 32GB but you can still run out of space if you go all out with 4K video and apps. You can always get a wireless drive — Sandisk offers the Wireless Connect Stick in storage options of 16 to 200GB at prices starting at Rs 1,400. If you prefer a plug-in option, Sandisk offers the iXpand flash drive (Rs 3,600 onwards) and Leef has the iBridge (Rs 4,740 onwards) — both connect directly to the Lightning port on the iPhone.
CHARGE + MUSIC ADAPTERS

Thanks to the missing headphone jack, you won’t be able to charge and listen to music at the same time. Third-party accessory makers were quick to realize this and adapters have started appearing. Belkin has a Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar adapter priced at US$40. We’ve also seen the Fstop Labs Lightning Charging Port and Music Controller Converter for US$26 – both are on Amazon global.
STILL NEED MORE BATTERY LIFE?
Even though the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have slightly larger batteries than before, power users will require more juice. Once way is to carry a portable charger with you all the time – Xiaomi’s 20,000mAh charger is something you can use multiple times before you need to charge it. Another option is a battery case. At first, you’ll only get the official battery case from Apple (US$99) while third party cases like iBeek (US$ 30) and UNU-DX7+ (US$ 90) are available on Amazon US.
THE MISSING HEADPHONE JACK

Apple removed the headphone jack on the new iPhones and you will need to use the Lightning port or Bluetooth for audio. A pair of Lightning earbuds are included with the phone but not everyone likes the default set. For people who own other headphones, a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter is provided in the box (and you can buy additional ones). There are also other Apple certified Lightning headphones available from third party brands. Boat has the DSP 4000 in-ear headphones priced at Rs 1,999 — as a bonus, they also come with in-line controls and work with any iPhone with a Lightning port.
Better AirPods
These wireless headphones were announced by Apple along with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. While they look a lot like the traditional Apple
earbuds, they are two separate pieces which means you can lose them if you’re not careful. A simple solution for this is Spigen’s AirPod Strap (Rs 712 on www. mobilefun.com) – a high quality lanyard that snaps on to each Air-Pod so that they don’t fall down if you’re running or exercising. The strap has tangle-free design and can be stored by wrapping it around the AirPod case.

Apple is also launching its own wireless earphones called AirPods priced at £159.
Apple's working on adding a dedicated Portrait mode to thecamera app, which'll turn out images with deeper bokeh and depth of field, but it wasn't ready to try out at the launch event.
Apple has ditched the headphone jack on both iPhone models, instead connecting its new EarPods via Lightning cable.
"The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process". The high-end iPhone 7 Plus has a dual-camera system offeringdigital SLR quality photos with improved zoom capabilities. Luckily,Apple is bundling both a 3.5mm dongle andLightning audio wired earbuds with the iPhone 7 (and Plus). The home button now offers taptic feedback and you will feel a buzz from time to time.
Apple is fielding new iPhones and the Apple Watch Series 2 on the cusp of the crucial year-end holiday shopping season. Finally having an iPhone which is water-resistant and has a lot ofstorage is a start, but it's not necessarily worth theprice tag.
The Black iPhone 7 models are sold out. So what gives? Well, there are changes with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that help explain the vanishing headphone jack. There is, however, another, more problematic difference. We're now getting an idea of the pricing for this particular wearable, and it's not good news. And if it wasn't clear from attack ads, a 16GB iPhone was no longer something actually worth purchasing.
Apple sold almost 92 million iPhones during the first six months of this year, about 15 per cent fewer than the same period last year.
For the Plus model of the phone, the 32GB is $84 more expensive in Canada, while the top-end, 256GB version is $61 more expensive. Could a single Lightning-to-3.5-mm-jack-and-USB-and-Lightning adapter be on the cards?
The new smartphones come withApple seeking to reverse declines in sales of the iPhone in an increasingly saturated global market, and boost its Apple Watch. We can nearly hear you say thank God for that.

Higher iPhone sales than expected give Apple a rosy glow; TECHNOLOGY

Apple defied expectations by reporting its highest-ever quarterly revenue, driven by higher-than-expected iPhone sales.
The California company shifted 78.3 million iPhones during the fourth financial quarter of 2016, beating its previous sales high of 74.8 million units this time last year. Sales of the iPhone 7 Plus were particularly strong, the chief executive, Tim Cook, said.
While Apple's sales are always traditionally higher in the Christmas quarter, the lukewarm reception to the iPhone 7 when it was released in September led analysts to predict sales of around 77.4 million.
Analysts had also voiced concerns Apple had reached "peak iPhone" after sales of the smartphone fell for the first time in its history last February, and continued to do so for the following two quarters.
The company reported $78.4bn (£62.3bn) in quarterly revenue - its highest to date - $54.3bn of which came from iPhone sales alone. Sales of Mac laptops and desktop computers brought in $7.2bn, while iPads made $5.5bn.
The Apple Watch and other products, which include iPods, its wireless AirPods and Apple TV, raked in $4bn.
The App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, Apple's services branch, made $7.1bn, coming close to edging out the Mac as its secondary source of income. This was largely driven by the App Store, sales from which were up 43 per cent year-on-year.
Mr Cook said that iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch had set revenue records, but declined to reveal sales figures or specified revenue from the latter.
Meanwhile, iPad sales continued to fall. Apple sold 13.1 million tablets, a 19 per cent year-on-year drop that contributed to a 22 per cent fall in revenue in the division.
iPhone sales, which account for two-thirds of Apple's annual revenue, are critical to the company's continued success.
However, general global smartphone sales are beginning to slow, as fewer people are buying phones for the first time and are tending to upgrade less frequently, which is why Apple is focusing on developing new products.
Apple is expected to pull out all the stops when it releases the iPhone 8 in September. The iPhone was launched in 2007, so this year is its 10th anniversary.

With its customary hype, rumours and fanfare, Apple yesterday unveiled its iPhone 7. National technology writer ROD CHESTER gives his review of the new features.
THE big news with the iPhone 7 was supposed to be that Apple was dropping the headphone jack. Yes, that happened, but the really big news is what you'll be able to do with the new iPhone 7 Plus camera.
Apple has never worried about the megapixel race but has focused on ensuring the camera takes really good pictures. That's why you see those "Shot on iPhone" posters around town, which highlight some amazing photos that non-photographers have taken with their phone.
Apple CEO Tim Cook took the helm at Apple's biggest launch of the year - which included a performance by Adelaide-born singer Sia Furler - unveiling a new model iPhone and Apple Watch, which are both faster, smarter and, at last, waterproof.
But again the biggest thing about the iPhone launch in San Francisco yesterday is the camera. Sure, the camera in the iPhone 7 has been improved, with a better sensor, wider f1.8 aperture and better processing. It's still a 12-megapixel camera, although the front-facing camera has been upgraded to seven megapixels.
But it's impossible not to breeze over that and head straight to the iPhone 7 Plus, which has dual cameras with two lenses protruding from the back. One camera is the standard wide photo, the other is a telephoto.
To switch between the two, open up the camera mode, touch "1x" at the bottom of the frame and it instantly switches to the 2x zoom lens.
Apple also lets users get closer to their subject in their photograph with a dial that lets you increase the zoom to 10x, although the range between 2x and 10x is done with software rather than a lens.
The rule with digital zoom on any smartphone is never use it - it's not worth it. Whether Apple has produced something that breaks that rule is hard to say in just a few minutes of playing with the phone.
I shot a few 10x frames in a dark room with shaky hands and the zoomed images were OK but not great. However, a fairer test will be when we get to take one in the real world.
If you commit to the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus, you also get a new mode in the camera called Portraits. n that mode, the camera automatically detects faces and keeps them sharply in focus while blurring the background.
There are plenty of apps that have tried to do this, but an initial look at results shot with the iPhone 7 Plus is that Apple has got it right.
Although it has also got it right a bit too late - this effect won't be on the iPhone 7 Plus at release date but will come out as a software by the end of the year.
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have the same form factor as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus although, aside from the dual lens, there are a few subtle differences so that eagle-eyed folk will notice you have a shiny new phone.
The antenna band no longer goes across the back of the phone but is on the edge. And the audio jack is gone.
Apple spent a lot of time yesterday talking about wireless earphones, from a new range of Beats to AirPods that protrude from your ears like little sticks.
Maybe dropping the jack will be the catalyst needed to drive people into wireless headphones.
Apple has a history of dropping "essential" items from devices and, after initial grumbling, people soon learn to live without.
There is a new chip that will make this faster - but there is always a new chip to make every new iPhone faster. Perhaps the only surprise with the chip is that it is called the A10 Fusion, which is an update on last year's A9.
Apple has promised this will have the best battery life of any iPhone, which suggests that maybe some of the space saved with the headphone jack has been used by a bigger battery.
The home button looks the same but doesn't act the same. It's no longer a physical button but a solid piece of glass that gives the sense of movement through Taptic feedback.
That sense of movement through specific vibration is not just on the home button and will also add to the game play on iOS games.
The screen is brighter with a wider colour gamut and there is now stereo sound on the iPhone, although it is hard to properly test that in a crowded room of enthusiastic tech reporters.
Something to file under the "At Long Last" heading is the waterproof feature. If you drop this iPhone in the loo or jump in the pool with it in your pocket, you're safe.
I've reviewed the past five iPhone models and every time I wrote "should be waterproof". Better late than never.
Joining waterproofing in that same category is the removal of the 16GB model of the iPhone, which was woefully too small.
Now the iPhone models start at 32GB, although if you want the fancy Jet Black model you'll need to get the 128GB or 256GB version.
So, do I love this iPhone 7? Yes, but I love the iPhone 7 Plus more. I've long been dismissive of phablet phones. Size is a preference when it comes to smartphones and I've always preferred the smaller 4.7-inch phone.
But the advantages of the dual cameras in the iPhone 7 Plus have me challenging my long-held views.
This could be the time to go big and get into the picture - both in the wide angle and with the zoom.
What is the best smartphone on the market? With the recall of Samsung's Note7 following reports of phones bursting into flames, there is only one answer.
It's not the iPhone 7. It is the iPhone 7 Plus.

iLost them already: iPhone7 fans queue in the rain for cordless kit

 THE iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have gone on sale in the UK, with keen customers queuing in the rain for the water-resistant devices which will support cordless earbuds.
The latest iPhones which were announced last week in San Francisco come in a black and jet black finish for the first time.
First in the queue at the Apple Store in Covent Garden was Paul du Buf, 49, from Croydon, who collected a silver iPhone 7.
Apple said yesterday that many versions of the phone had sold out in pre-order, and this morning's queues were made up of those who had reserved a spot to pick up a pre-ordered device.
"I'm just really excited about the new iPhone," said Mr du Buf, when asked why he chose to come so early.
"I really wanted the new camera and the new software."
Both the iPhone 7 and larger 7 Plus have been made water-resistant for the first time, while a new version of the Apple Watch, called the Series 2, has also gone on sale today.
Apple caused controversy when announcing the iPhone 7 when it revealed the new devices would no longer have a headphone jack, instead asking customers to connect headphones via the Lightning connector, or use wireless headsets.
A set of corldess "AirPods" will cost £159 when they go on sale next month.

IN 7TH HEAVEN

September 12, 2016 Monday

Apple launched its newest iPhones in San Francisco last week and fans here couldn't wait to get a byte too, writes Aiman Maulana
IT'S almost a tradition. For the past three years, Apple had always released its latest iPhones in September.
Whether you love it or hate it, one has to admit to being a little curious about new iPhones.
Will there be a brand new feature to blow us away? Will the screens be bigger? Will there be an improvement in the battery department?
MORE POWERFUL
The new iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus will be powered by Apple's new A10 Fusion chip. Apparently, this is so powerful that it is capable of console-level gaming. It is said to be 40 per cent faster than the previous A9 chip in the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone SE. It's also 50 per cent faster than the A9 chip in graphics performance.
The A10 Fusion chip is a 64-bit quadcore processor consisting of two high performance cores and two energy-efficient cores.
The energy-efficient cores are designed to help improve battery life, while the high performance cores will ensure smooth operations throughout.
GLOSSY GLORY
If you think the new iPhone 7 looks awfully familiar, I can't blame you. However, instead of the matte metal finish that we're so familiar with, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have a glossy, mirrored design. Something else that's very hard to miss is that it appears to have quite a bump on the camera, much like Huawei Nexus 6P.
iPhone 7 also comes in a new colour, Jet Black, that is darker and richer than Space Black.
Apple will also be releasing the new iPhones in standard black colour as well as gold, silver and rose gold.
Aesthetics aside, Apple has confirmed that the new iPhones are IP67 water-resistant. I still wouldn't take a bath with it though.
IMPROVED CAMERA
The camera in the new iPhone 7 has been upgraded to include optical image stabilisation and a bright f/1.8 lens which is said to allow 50 per cent more light than the f/2.2 lens in iPhone 6s. It still has a 12-megapixel sensor but is now 60 per cent faster and 30 per cent more efficient. This means shooting photos will bemore convenient. The front camera has been upgraded to 7 megapixels, along with automatic image stabilisation for better selfies and video recording.
The biggest upgrade is in the iPhone 7 Plus which features a dual-camera system with 2x optical zoom. One of the lenses is a 28mm wide angle lens while the other is a 60mm telephoto lens. With an upcoming software update, you can use both lenses on the iPhone 7 Plus to mimic a shallow depth of field, similar to what you can get with DSLRs.
However, due to the camera's sensor size, subjects would have to be close to the camera for it to work.
REDESIGNED HOME BUTTON
The iPhone's signature home button is also new. It is pressure-sensitive and no longer clicks. It does simulate the click via vibration, similar to the ForceTouch trackpad on Macbooks. The home button has the Taptic Engine haptic feedback system from the Apple Watch, which can provide different vibration feedbacks for specific types of notifications.
AU REVOIR HEADPHONE JACK!
Rumours have been circulating for quite some time about the removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone.
It's true. In its place is a secondary speaker, which effectively means that the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have stereo speakers. To utilise the headphones, you will need to connect it via the Lightning port, which is a good thing as it means that Apple is moving towards digital audio with the iPhones, which means better audio quality.
Along with the new iPhone, Apple announced a new set of wireless headphones known as the AirPods.
It looks like the old earpods but is wireless and uses sensors to detect when plugged into your ears. You can use it to activate Siri. If you want to use headphones which utilises the standard stereo jack, the iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus comes with a Lightning adapter for it. Yes, this means you can't listen to music on your earphones when charging the device.
BEST BATTERY LIFE YET
The iPhone 7 will have approximately two hours more battery life than iPhone 6S, while the iPhone 7 Plus has an extra hour compared to the iPhone 6S Plus. This may not seem like much but a little improvement is still better than nothing.
MORE STORAGE
What is probably the best news is that there will no longer be a 16GB version for the new iPhones. The lowest storage capacity is now 32GB. There will also be 128GB and 256GB variants.
HOW MUCH
The iPhone 7 is priced from USD649 (about RM2,626) and the iPhone 7 Plus is USD769 (about RM3,100).

BRITS will pay more than £100 more than some US shoppers for the new iPhone 7, it has emerged.
The UK starting price of the phone's cheapest 32GB model is £599, compared to an average retail price of £518 in the US.
In states that do not pay sales tax the cost will be just £486, meaning a price difference of £113.
The gadget, unveiled on Wednesday night in San Francisco, is water resistant, has an improved camera and has been redesigned to remove the headphone jack.
Hannah Summersfield, of the consumer group A Spokesman Said, slammed the price difference.
She said: "It's totally outrageous that Brits should have to stump up over £100 more than buyers in the US.
"The question is, why are consumers being penalised by Apple yet again? "Shoppers who feel this is unfair shouldn't be afraid to shun the hype."
She added: "There are plenty of great alternatives to the iPhone on the market and many are lots cheaper." Apple has also released a Series 2 Apple Watch as well as wireless earphones called Airpods.
The Watch, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go on sale on September 16, with pre-orders for the devices beginning today.
A spokesman said: "Apple suggests product prices internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices and taxes.
"These factors vary from region to region and over time, such that international prices are not always comparable to US suggested retail prices."

IPhone 7 and Wireless Headphones: Analyzing Apple's Announcements
The New York Times
September 8, 2016 Thursday, The New York Times on the Web

SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple unveiled new iPhones at an event on Wednesday, as it has done every September for the last few years.
The event, held in San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, was the company's most important outing of the year. Even as the iPhone remains the outsize producer of Apple's revenue and profit, sales of the smartphone have recently been declining. So more than ever, the onus is on Apple to keep up excitement for the gadget. 
  What was different this time was that people were focused on something that the new iPhones lack, rather than a flashy new feature. The item that disappeared is the traditional headphone jack, with Apple turning people toward wireless headphones instead.
  Brian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Katie Benner were at the event to provide live analysis of what you need to know about the announcements, not what you don't.
  Here's what Apple announced:
  â–  New iPhones, called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.
  â–  The new iPhones lack a headphone jack.
  â–  The new iPhones have a revised home button with force sensitivity, which will vibrate to give feedback.
  â–  The iPhones are water-resistant.
  â–  The Plus model of the new iPhone includes a dual-lens camera to take professional-grade photos.
  â–  A new Apple Watch, called Apple Watch Series 2, which includes GPS.
  â–  PokÃ©mon Go is available for Apple Watch.
  â–  An update on how Apple Music is performing.
  â–  Tweaks to its iWork suite of productivity apps.
  The Big Picture
  Farhad: This was a tricky event because there wasn't much new to the products. The iPhone has the same design as last year's (and the one the year before) and the major new thing is ... a missing headphone jack. So what I was watching for was Apple's reality distortion field: How will Apple's C.E.O., Tim Cook, and friends convince us that taking away a feature is really an advance for the iPhone?
  Brian: As Farhad said, the new iPhones -- and also the Watches -- look largely the same as their predecessors. The takeaway for me was that Apple focused on making the most significant changes to the tiniest components: camera sensors, upgraded chips, a revised home button and the addition of GPS to the watch. I get the impression that they are saving the big changes for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone next year.
  So if consumers can hold off a year for the next iPhone, I'd encourage them to wait. But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades -- if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.
  Katie: Apple didn't offer a new killer product or a drastic update to any of the products in its lineup. Instead, Apple piled on new features -- like water-resistance, stereo speakers, wireless headphones and camera features -- to appeal to specific niche buyers. Frank Gillett at Forrester Research called this strategy an accumulation of compelling new features that Apple hopes will ''motivate the trend followers to buy new iPhones, and expose other buyers to the benefits they've built into iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2.''
  Perhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves -- that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.
  Farhad: Apple likes road maps. That's what you saw today. The company clearly has deep, long-term plans for the iPhone -- it wants to improve wireless functioning, it wants to keep pushing on the camera, and it will keep improving performance without sacrificing battery life.
  The problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren't always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling -- we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack -- and we may just have to live with the confusion.
  Software and Services
  Katie: For the past few quarters, Apple has emphasized that services and software will drive growth as iPhone revenue ebbs. At Wednesday's event, Mr. Cook underlined that. He kicked off the morning with updates on two of the company's most important software and services divisions -- Apple Music and the App Store.
  ''We've always had a deep love for music,'' Mr. Cook said. ''It inspires us, and it's a key part of our product experience.''
  Mr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the ''premier destination for exclusive music,'' nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.
  Brian: In another nod to software, Mr. Cook said Super Mario is coming to the App Store. Nintendo, the struggling video game company, long refused to offer its games and franchise characters on mobile devices, but the company recently did a 180, with PokÃ©mon Go as a recent example. The change seems more beneficial to Nintendo than to Apple. PokÃ©mon Go was a huge success, at least initially, proving that app stores are a viable revenue stream for Nintendo beyond its consoles.
  Apple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google's productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It's good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.
  Farhad: The education market has been important to Apple for decades, and for the last few years it has pushed the iPad as the perfect school computer. It did so again today, with those tweaks to its iWork software aimed at schools.
  But Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies -- and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon -- the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.
  Apple Watch
  Brian: The new Apple Watch is called Apple Watch Series 2. It emphasizes fitness and health, with Apple showing a video of runners, gymnasts and swimmers using the watch. One major criticism of Apple Watch was that it did a bit of everything and did not have any strengths. Apple is trying to beef up the fitness capabilities, similar to Fitbit. The new version is water-resistant up to 50 meters (164 feet). It also includes GPS for tracking runs. The watch is faster than the previous version.
  Katie: Whether Apple Watch has been successful or not has largely been a mystery. Apple doesn't break out Watch revenue in its earnings. But Mr. Cook pulled back the curtain a little when he revealed that Apple is now the No. 2 global watch brand, measured by revenue, behind Rolex. The Apple Watch is also the top-selling smartwatch, even though a killer app has yet to emerge for the watch. The company is hoping to change that with the introduction of a PokÃ©mon Go app for the watch.
  Brian: It's important to note that Apple Watch sales don't appear to be growing much. IDC, the research firm, estimates that Apple Watch market share in the wearables market shrank 56.7 percent last quarter compared to the same period last year. That's largely because consumers have probably been waiting for a new version to come out before deciding whether to buy a watch. It's definitely still a nascent device.
  Farhad: This is the first Apple event in a few years that didn't feature any redesigned hardware. But there is a new ceramic finish for the Watch that comes closest to some new design.
  The gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it's always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company's lineup over a few years' time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.
  Brian: For now, my advice to consumers: I see no compelling reason for people with Version One of the device to upgrade unless they are fitness buffs.
  The addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit's Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it's tough to tell how the new Apple Watch's fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit's products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn't necessarily the magic bullet.
  The iPhone
  Katie: Leading up to the event, the most ballyhooed update was Apple's decision to eliminate the headphone jack. On Wednesday, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, saved that announcement for last.
  Removing the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.
  ''From the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,'' Mr. Schiller said.
  The update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.
  Why remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: ''Courage.''
  Farhad: Apple said the most important reason it's removing the headphone jack is because it believes in a ''wireless future'' for audio. It's making that future a reality with a new set of wireless headphones, called AirPods. They look like Apple's wired earbuds, without the wires; they apparently just slip in your ears.
  Perhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.
  Brian: Jony Ive, Apple's design chief, said in a video at the event that we are ''just at the beginning of a truly wireless future.'' But wireless earphones have been around for years, and Bluetooth wireless technology has become excellent. This is another example of Apple's being a latecomer to a market and saying it will make a better product than earlier ones.
  Farhad: The reality distortion was in force in other ways. In true Apple fashion, we got a deep-dive video into the development process for the iPhone 7, with not even a nod to the fact that the phone looks nearly identical to the one Apple released last year and the one the year before. Because it has a new color and a new Apple logo, Apple insists it's ''a beautiful new design.''
  I'm sure there are minor differences -- the antenna band is different -- but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.
  One area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone's camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it's better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone's camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone's camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras. Look forward to more of those ''Shot on iPhone'' billboards.

SAN FRANCISCO - The Latest on Apple's San Francisco product event (all times Pacific):
11:45 a.m.
Apple events have historically had ripple effects on other technology stocks, and today was no exception. Fitbit saw its shares decline in the afternoon as Apple released details of its new iWatch. Shares in the wearable device maker had climbed to $15.38 in morning trading, but fell to $14.85 after the Apple announcement.
Nintendo, on the other hand, got a boost from the event. Its shares climbed almost 5 per cent after Apple announced that the game "Super Mario Runs" was coming to the iPhone. Nintendo had previously resisted releasing Mario games to mobile phones.
11:40 a.m.
Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service, will come to Japan in October. Apple will include a new wireless technology called Felica in iPhones and Apple Watches there.
In the U.S. and elsewhere, mobile payments use a wireless technology called NFC. A transit feature in Apple Maps will also launch in Japan.
11:30 a.m.
Apple's next iPhones will come without the analog headphone jack that's been standard on iPhones and most other electronic devices for years.
Instead, the company is making iPhone owners listen with wireless Bluetooth headsets or with earphones that can plug into the phone's digital "Lightning" port, which has been used primarily for charging.
The long-rumoured decision to ditch the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack could cause an outcry from consumers. Critics have already complained that their old headphones won't fit in the charging port without an adapter. There's also the dilemma of where to plug in a set of headphones if the charging port is already being used to plug in a power cord.
Apple will include an adapter with the iPhone 7 for those with older headphones.
Apple marketing chief Philip W. Schiller says it comes down to "courage to move on to something new."
Schiller says removing the port frees up space in the phone for newer technologies. He also says the Lightning port was designed years ago with digital audio in mind.
Apple designed new wireless headphones called AirPods to replace the traditional ear buds. Schiller didn't mention a price for the wireless earphones.
Apple isn't the first to ditch the headphone jack. Motorola quietly did so a month ago with some models of the Moto Z.
The new iPhones are getting stereo speakers - one on each side of the phone - along with a display capable of reproducing a wider range of colours.
11:20 a.m.
Apple says it's upgrading the camera and flash components for the new iPhone 7, and it's making an even bigger change in the iPhone 7 Plus.
The larger model will come with two digital camera lenses. One will be for regular shots and the other will have telephoto capabilities, giving you a two-fold zoom. Smartphones typically have resorted to software tricks for zooms, resulting in fuzzy images when blown up.
Both lenses will take photos at 12 megapixels.
The two lenses will also sense depth and allow users to blur backgrounds in images, mimicking an effect that typically requires changing the lens aperture in stand-alone cameras.
Other smartphone makers including LG and Motorola are also starting to offer models with dual lenses to improve picture quality. While many consumers likely feel their current phone cameras are "good enough," analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research says the extra capabilities may appeal to millions of people who like to post photos on social media, in the hope of impressing friends and earning "likes" for their posts.
Dawson says the new smartphone cameras still don't match the capabilities of SLR cameras, but they offer improvements that may appeal to the "vanity" of social media users.
Other camera improvements include a new flash with four rather than two shades of colour to match ambient light. High-end photographers can get images in RAW format, which allows for more versatile editing, matching what many leading cameras now have.
Apple is announcing the iPhone 7 at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday.
11:10 a.m.
Apple's iPhone is getting an updated home button and will come with water and dust protection.
Apple says the iPhone 7 is now force sensitive, so responses can differ based on how hard you press it. It's similar to what Apple has done with a trackpad in a slimmer MacBook model last year.
Camera improvements include a new flash with four rather than two shades of colour to match ambient light.
It's one of several new features Apple is introducing at an event in San Francisco.
11 a.m.
Those who aren't getting a new iPhone will still see improvements with a new mobile operating system called iOS 10.
Among other things, the software will add more intelligence to Apple services like Maps, Photos, the iPhone keyboard and Siri, the voice-activated digital assistant. There's a new Home app to control appliances.
In a big change for Apple, the company is also opening Siri and its iMessage service to work with apps created by independent developers. Siri will be able to send message to a contact on LinkedIn, the professional social network being bought by Microsoft, or to a friend on WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service. Siri can also send money with the Square Cash service or search for pictures on Pinterest.
Apple is also allowing developers to build apps for iMessage, although the options so far appear to be mostly sending payments or ordering food. It's also adding bigger emoji and other visual effects for iMessage, including what it calls "Invisible Ink," which blurs an image in a message until a recipient swipes a finger across the screen.
Apple announced many of the features in June.
10:50 a.m.
A new version of Apple's smartwatch will come with GPS tracking for more accurate workouts and enough water resistance to swim with it, although the company didn't mention anything about its expected battery life.
Although the first Apple Watch can tap the GPS on a companion phone, that means carrying the phone with you as you hike or run. GPS isn't common in smartwatches, though the upcoming Samsung Gear S3 will also get GPS.
The previous Apple Watch model is resistant to splashes, but not extensive use in water.
Apple says one of the engineering challenges has been sealing the speaker port, which needs air to work. The company said it designed the speaker to eject water after workouts. Fitbit has one swim-proof model and Garmin has a few, but the capability isn't common.
The Apple Watch update was announced 17 months after the first model came out. The "Series 2" watch will also get a faster processor and a brighter display for outdoor use.
New styles include a case made of ceramic and a run-centric design made in collaboration with Nike.
The original model is getting a price cut, to $269 from $300, and will get a faster processor. The Series 2 Apple Watch will start at $369. The updates are coming Sept. 16. Existing watches can get new software on Sept. 13.
10:40 a.m.
"Pokemon Go" is coming to the Apple Watch.
John Hanke, CEO of "Pokemon" creator Niantic Labs, says the idea is to allow you to focus more on your surroundings and not the phone while playing. It's coming later this year.
Hanke says the game has been downloaded more than 500 million times, and people playing have collectively walked 4.6 billion kilometres (2.9 billion miles).
Hanke said, "It's certainly been a busy summer for us."
He announced the watch app at an Apple event in San Francisco on Wednesday. CEO Tim Cook joked that the watch app might let him finally break out of Level 2.
Earlier, Apple announced that the Mario video game is coming to iPhones.
10:30 a.m.
Apple says real-time collaboration features are coming to its word processing, spreadsheet and presentation package.
It's something Google and Microsoft already offer in some form. Although Apple's iWork package allows syncing through iCloud, it's has been primarily for one person to work on documents at a time.
The software is available for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, with a web version for Windows users.
10:15 a.m.
The video game character Mario is coming to iPhones. CEO Tim Cook said the popular Japanese game had been missing until now.
Shigeru Miyamoto, described as the "Father of Mario" from Nintendo, said through a translator that "Super Mario Runs" is designed to be played one-handed - while holding a handle on the subway, eating a hamburger or . eating an apple.
Miyamoto didn't announce the price, but said the game will sell for a fixed price, so you won't have to keep ponying up as you advance through the game.
Nintendo has long resisted bringing Mario to mobile phones, instead relying on the character to bolster demand for its own hand-held DS gaming systems.
The event in San Francisco on Wednesday started with video showing TV host James Corden driving to the event and bantering with Cook about how he ought to wear a suit made of apples. As Cook walked on stage, he puts on the funny glasses from the ride, then shook his head and threw them offstage.
9:30 a.m.
Eyes are on Apple on Wednesday as the company prepares to unveil expected new iPhones and other products at an event in San Francisco starting at 1 p.m. EDT.
Analysts say the new iPhones could help Apple recover modestly from a recent dip in sales. But with few expected dramatic changes from previous models, Apple watchers aren't expecting the kind of big spikes in consumer demand that the company saw two years ago, when it introduced larger screens.
Apple sold nearly 92 million iPhones during the first six months of this year, about 15 per cent fewer than the same period last year. This year marks the first time that Apple has seen such declines. Industry analysts say it's because last fall's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus didn't contain many new features or improvements.
Investors are hoping for a bigger boost in sales next year. Wall Street analysts say reports from Apple's Asian manufacturers and suppliers indicate the company has decided to wait a year before introducing a major overhaul of the phone in 2017. That will be the iPhone's 10th anniversary.

Iphone 7 gets updated camera, flash

SAN FRANCISCO - The Latest on Apple's San Francisco product event (all times Pacific):
11:45 a.m.
Apple events have historically had ripple effects on other technology stocks, and today was no exception. Fitbit saw its shares decline in the afternoon as Apple released details of its new iWatch. Shares in the wearable device maker had climbed to $15.38 in morning trading, but fell to $14.85 after the Apple announcement.
Nintendo, on the other hand, got a boost from the event. Its shares climbed almost 5 per cent after Apple announced that the game "Super Mario Runs" was coming to the iPhone. Nintendo had previously resisted releasing Mario games to mobile phones.
11:40 a.m.
Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service, will come to Japan in October. Apple will include a new wireless technology called Felica in iPhones and Apple Watches there.
In the U.S. and elsewhere, mobile payments use a wireless technology called NFC. A transit feature in Apple Maps will also launch in Japan.
11:30 a.m.
Apple's next iPhones will come without the analog headphone jack that's been standard on iPhones and most other electronic devices for years.
Instead, the company is making iPhone owners listen with wireless Bluetooth headsets or with earphones that can plug into the phone's digital "Lightning" port, which has been used primarily for charging.
The long-rumoured decision to ditch the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack could cause an outcry from consumers. Critics have already complained that their old headphones won't fit in the charging port without an adapter. There's also the dilemma of where to plug in a set of headphones if the charging port is already being used to plug in a power cord.
Apple will include an adapter with the iPhone 7 for those with older headphones.
Apple marketing chief Philip W. Schiller says it comes down to "courage to move on to something new."
Schiller says removing the port frees up space in the phone for newer technologies. He also says the Lightning port was designed years ago with digital audio in mind.
Apple designed new wireless headphones called AirPods to replace the traditional ear buds. Schiller didn't mention a price for the wireless earphones.
Apple isn't the first to ditch the headphone jack. Motorola quietly did so a month ago with some models of the Moto Z.
The new iPhones are getting stereo speakers - one on each side of the phone - along with a display capable of reproducing a wider range of colours.
11:20 a.m.
Apple says it's upgrading the camera and flash components for the new iPhone 7, and it's making an even bigger change in the iPhone 7 Plus.
The larger model will come with two digital camera lenses. One will be for regular shots and the other will have telephoto capabilities, giving you a two-fold zoom. Smartphones typically have resorted to software tricks for zooms, resulting in fuzzy images when blown up.
Both lenses will take photos at 12 megapixels.
The two lenses will also sense depth and allow users to blur backgrounds in images, mimicking an effect that typically requires changing the lens aperture in stand-alone cameras.
Other smartphone makers including LG and Motorola are also starting to offer models with dual lenses to improve picture quality. While many consumers likely feel their current phone cameras are "good enough," analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research says the extra capabilities may appeal to millions of people who like to post photos on social media, in the hope of impressing friends and earning "likes" for their posts.
Dawson says the new smartphone cameras still don't match the capabilities of SLR cameras, but they offer improvements that may appeal to the "vanity" of social media users.
Other camera improvements include a new flash with four rather than two shades of colour to match ambient light. High-end photographers can get images in RAW format, which allows for more versatile editing, matching what many leading cameras now have.
Apple is announcing the iPhone 7 at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday.

iPhone 7 launch pushes Apple's wireless vision; Technology

Apple's iPhone 7 launched this week amid more hype and controversy than ever.
While some observers bemoaned the incremental nature of its innovations, such as longer battery life and better camera, many customers took umbrage over its move to scrap the 3.5mm headphone jack.
Apple sought to smooth over the fuss by including a free adaptor that allows standard headphones to use its Lightning port with every new iPhone.
The cable is also sold separately for $9, while accessory maker Belkin is offering a $40 dongle that will allow users to listen to music and charge their iPhone 7 at the same time.
Despite Apple's bid to sell customers on its vision for a wireless future, marketing chief Phil Schiller was lampooned on social media for his comments on stage in San Francisco that the decision to go into wireless audio was out of "courage to move on".
The move was accompanied by a $159 pair of wireless AirPods, which use an Apple chip called W1 for faster pairing and a more reliable connection.
The headphone argument drowned out some other pieces of bad news for Apple. British iPhone buyers will be paying the price of Brexit in the form of an extra £60 on the cost of the basic model of the new handset. While the US starting price remains the same as last year at $650 - now with more memory for the money - the iPhone 7 begins at £600 in the UK.
The launch of the "Series 2" Apple Watch also masked the company's admission of defeat in the ultra-luxury market. The gold Apple Watch Edition released last year, which had cost up to $17,000, is no more. The most expensive model now comes in a ceramic white finish and is priced from £1,249.
Another potential cause of controversy is Apple's decision not to release sales figures for its opening weekend. The move may be seen as reluctance to announce a debut that failed to set a record, as every year before it has.

iPhone 7 launch: Seven things that you need to know

It's just over 24 hours remaining for the new iPhone 7 launch. And the tech world has gone into a frenzy, and for good reasons.
In the biggest smartphone launch of the year, Apple will unveil the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 plus on Wednesday. It will, like always, be live-streaming the launch.
Here are seven things that you need to know about the newest members of the Apple family.
1.Venue: It's the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco that will be hosting the grand event. Apparently, the auditorium has been jazzed up for the biggest smartphone.
2.Chip: Preliminary reports suggest that the iPhone 7 will be powered by Apple's new A10 chip offering a maximum clock speed of 2.4 GHz.
3.What's out: The tech major is likely to drop 16GB and 64GB models and add a 256GB variant. As a result, Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models will come in 32GB, 128 GB and 256GB variants. Both the iPhones are also likely to get a RAM boost.
4.Thin is In: If rumours are to be believed, Apple is apparently aiming to make the iPhone 7 up to 1mm thinner. Tech wizards hint that it will perhaps do away with the traditional headphone jack. Also, the iPhone 7 may finally reveal the Apple's rumored wireless "AirPods" earbuds.
5.Water-safe: Dropped your phone into the sink? Chill! The new iPhones will be water-resistant.
6.Picture-Perfect: There have not been too many complaints about the iPhone 6 camera. But things may get better with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Both cameras will have 12-megapixel sensors.
7.Desi love: The good news is that we can expect the company to launch the device in India before Diwali. This means you have to re-budget your Diwali expenses.
All of the above information is speculative as nothing has been revealed officially about the iPhone 7 by Apple so far.

Hyderabad, Sept. 7 -- Before the launch of iPhone 7 today, here are seven things that you need to know about the newest members of the Apple family.

iPHONE 7 MORE FOR BRITS

BRITISH buyers will pay £113 more for the new iPhone 7 than Americans because of the plunging value of the pound.
It will cost between 11% and 17% more than the iPhone 6 last September.
Economic analyst Adam Corlett said the increase "roughly matches the fall in the value of the pound over the same period". He added: "For many people this might be the one of the first big examples of the effect of a weaker pound, and rising import prices like this can be expected to feed into broader inflation figures."
While the new Apple smartphone will have a starting price of £599 in the UK for the cheapest version, in the US it starts at $649 (£486).
Apple bosses have also revealed new £119 wireless earphones, called AirPods, that will connect to both the iPhone and Apple Watch remotely.

iPhone 7 'no game changer' for Wall St

Not even chief executive Tim Cook singing Sweet Home Alabama on Carpool Karaoke could get Wall Street excited about the launch of Apple's iPhone 7.
The new iPhone, which features a high-resolution camera and the option of a jet-black glossy finish but notably lacks the traditional analog headphone jack, is not revolutionary, analysts said.
"Overall, we thought that the phone was an improvement over previous models, but not a game changer that will reignite a significant upgrade cycle," Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note.
Apple shares, which closed up 0.6 per cent on Thursday (NZ time) when the new phones were launched, were down more than 2 per cent at US$106.04 (NZ$143.3) in morning trading yesterday.
The shares had closed down nearly 2 per cent last year on the day the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were unveiled.
The iPhone 7 is priced from US$649 (NZ$1199), the same as its predecessor, the 6s. The larger iPhone 7 Plus edition will retail from US$769 (NZ$1429) - US$20 more than the 6s Plus - and will feature two cameras, including a telephoto lens.
Wells Fargo expects Apple to sell between 14 million and 15m of the new iPhones in the first weekend as the phones will be released in more countries than in previous years.
The company sold more than 13m of the 6s and 6s Plus phones in the first weekend after their launch last year.
The new phones will start shipping in major markets, including the United States and China, on September 16. That would give Apple 14 days of sales this quarter, compared with two days for the iPhone 6s in the year-ago quarter.
The company said it will not release first-weekend iPhone sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand.
Sales of all iPhone models account for more than half of Apple's revenue.
Apple typically refreshes the iPhone every year, but goes in for a big makeover once in two years.
However, many are expecting a three- year cycle this time, leading up to a major redesign in 2017.
"While iPhone 8 has the potential to be a big cycle, we believe there is limited visibility given the off cycle and, if history is an indicator, believe it too early to be investable," Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said.
Investment banking firm Craig- Hallum said it expected Apple to sell 211m iPhones in the fiscal year ending September - marking the first ever year- over-year decline in annual sales - before bouncing back to an estimated 221m in devices sales in 2017 and 240m in 2018. -Reuters

iPhone 7: What is it really like?; Lucy Hedges road-tests Apple's new handset to see if it's worth the hype
Metro (UK)

APPLE'S September keynote is one of the biggest events in the tech calendar, and on Wednesday the company's senior vice president of worldwide marketing took to the stage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco to introduce the world to its next-generation iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.
While you may get a sense of déjà vu on the design front, the similarly styled aluminium handsets can now survive a dip in the wet stuff minus the subsequent tears due to their long-awaited IP67 water-resistant (and dust too) status. The home button has been given a new pressure-sensitive makeover so it can detect how hard you're pressing down on it and will allow for further customised control.
But the biggest and most divisive change has to be the death of the 3.5mm headphone jack. From bendgate to software bugs, Apple is no stranger to criticism and controversy, but the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus could be its most contentious handsets yet, thanks to the decision to bundle them with Lightning port EarPods.
If you're not ready to embrace a wire-free listening experience or ditch your expensive wired 'phones, a Lightning-to-analogue adapter will be in the box to avoid rendering your purchase useless. Phew.
Alternatively, you could take advantage of Apple's wireless AirPods (due October). However, with a £159 price tag and the potential to spend your life searching for a bud you keep misplacing, they could be a tough sell.
On the camera front, both phones now pack 12MP snappers with optical image stabilisation. They fare better in low light, offer a wider colour range and are more energy-efficient. The front-facing camera's been upgraded too, with a 7MP FaceTime HD sensor for those Instagram selfies.
But it's the iPhone 7 Plus that steals the spotlight with its dual-camera set-up. On top of the standard 12MP wide-angle lens, the 7 Plus has a second 12MP telephoto lens to offer up more zoom capabilities; from 2x optical zoom, all the way to 10x digital zoom without any apparent loss in quality, say Apple.
As with all iPhone updates, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have more powerful processors and graphical grunt. And with the promise of the 'best iPhone battery life ever', Apple reckons the iPhone 7 will deliver on average two more hours of battery life than the iPhone 6s, with a further hour of juice on the 7 Plus.
The 7 will be available from next Friday in four colours. As for price: the 32GB iPhone 7 will set you back £599 and £799 for the new gargantuan 256GB option, while the iPhone 7 Plus starts from £719 and goes all the way up to £919 for the largest option. Is it the best iPhone ever? Watch this space… Connect Page 41»

LG gets chance to outpace struggling Samsung, Apple

[THE INVESTOR] LG Electronics, a long-time underdog in the premium smartphone war, has got a chance to step up its game against its compatriot rival Samsung Electronics and US-based Apple.
Samsung has been reeling from a series of fire and explosion cases of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone that have made headlines around the world.
Despite its all-out efforts to minimize the impact of the battery crisis, such as the largest-scale smartphone recall in history, some consumers are still afraid of using the Note 7, even boycotting Samsung smartphones.
A loss of reputation and trust of consumers seems inevitable for Samsung now.
LG Electronics' V20
Meanwhile, Apple faces problems of its own. Even before its latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus went on sale on Sept. 19, many critics were skeptical about their success.
The US tech firm's decision to ditch the headphone jack is pointed as its biggest blunder.
With no headphone jack in the new iPhones, users have to buy Apple's wireless earbuds, dubbed AirPods, which come at a hefty price tag of US$159.
On the design front, the earbuds with a long rod protruding, have been criticized for being "atrocious".
In addition, many worry that the tiny and wireless earphones can be easily lost, not to mention its mediocre sound quality.
iPhone 7 users also have to carry the charging dock to make sure the wireless earbuds do not run out of battery.
Kuo Ming-Chi, an analyst from research firm KGI, said in his report that Apple will not be able to sell as many handsets as it did with the iPhone 6S, anticipating that the sales volume will come in at around 70 million to 75 million units.
LG's upcoming V20, on the other hand, mainly focuses on improving multimedia functions, including the audio system and the cameras.
The tech firm has teamed up with Bang & Olufsen to roll out quality earphones, not wireless, which will come with the handset for free.
The LG smartphone, running on the latest version of Google's operating system Nougat, features a removable battery and a metal back cover, which could be appealing factors for many.
Park Hyung-woo, an analyst from SK Securities, said in an investment report that "The release of the V20 will help improve the profits of LG's mobile business to some extent."
"The sales performance of the V20, however, will be short of turning things around of the firm's struggling mobile business," he added.

Global stocks climbed on Wednesday as a slew of weak US economic data increased speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as early as this month. European markets ended a choppy session slightly higher, with investors assessing a larger than expected drop in German industrial production before the European Central Bank issues its next policy decision on Thursday. Meanwhile Wall Street took a turn lower after some choppy trade as investors braced for a product announcement by Apple.  

The FTSE 100 managed to close in the green, registering a 0.2% gain after it had wandered in and out of negative territory throughout the session. Overall, recent U.K. economic data, reflecting the environment in the wake of the Brexit vote, have surpassed expectations. The pound on Tuesday rose above $1.34 for the first time since mid-July.  

Concerns about Europe’s largest economy cropped up Wednesday as German industrial production dropped 1.5% in July, as manufacturing output declined. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a monthly fall of 0.3%. Germany’s DAX 30 held to a thin gain of 0.58% during Wednesday’s session.  

Amongst individual movers, Sports Direct International tumbled 8.5% after the apparel retailer said it expects full year 2017 earnings to be in the region of £300 million. This figure raised some eyebrows amongst investors, especially when considering that the fiscal profit for 2016 was £381.4 million. Sports Direct is holdings its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday. Sport Direct shares have lost about 46% year-to-date.  

But shares of Ashtead Group bounced 3% higher after the equipment-rental company upgraded its fiscal 2017 expectations after recording first-quarter earnings growth.  

Shares of Volkswagen were also trading higher, with the German car maker in advanced talks with a Chinese auto maker China Anhui Jianghuai Automobile, to produce electric cars in the country. Volkswagen shares added 1.26% on Wednesday.  

Oil futures traded mostly higher on Wednesday, ahead of the latest weekly updates on U.S. petroleum supplies, with traders weighing the likelihood that major producers will reach a deal to curb output later this month. Prices started cruising toward $50 a barrel earlier this week, following the announcement that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to cooperate to stabilize the oil market. But without a specific plan to cap output, future prices have struggled for direction amid skepticism over whether a formal deal would be forthcoming. Crude oil added 1.3% on Wednesday, to end the day at $45.40 per barrel.

All eyes were on Apple on Wednesday evening, as the tech giant rolled out its latest updated product. The iPhone 7 is set to include camera upgrades, a faster processor, longer battery life and a new water and dust-resistant design. Apple have also ditched headphone jacks to make room for other features, and the company showed off new headphones called AirPods that connect wirelessly to the new iPhones – but these will set you back $159! Shares of Apple traded 1% higher after the news.

Neues iPhone soll Apple aus Flaute führen

Highlight: Der Klinkenstecker für Kopfhörer ist Vergangenheit / "Super Mario" kommt aufs Smartphone
Body


Apple geht ins Weihnachtsgeschäft mit neuen iPhones ohne die gewohnte Klinkenstecker-Buchse für Ohrhörer. Außerdem wird das iPhone 7 widerstandsfähiger gegen Wasser und Staub, wie das schon diverse Konkurrenzgeräte vorgemacht haben.
Mit "Super Mario Go" für das Apple-Telefon bringt Nintendo erstmals eine seiner populären Spielefiguren auf ein Smartphone. Die Nintendo-Aktie sprang daraufhin zeitweise um 14 Prozent hoch. Und den Sommer-Hit "Pokémon Go" wird man künftig auch auf Apples Computer-Uhr spielen können.
Das iPhone ist das zentrale Apple-Produkt und brachte zuletzt mehr als die Hälfte der Erlöse des Konzerns ein. In diesem Jahr gehen die iPhone-Verkäufe aber erstmals seit dem Start des Geräts zurück. Jetzt steht die Weihnachtszeit an, in der Apple traditionell sein größtes Geschäft macht. Das iPhone 7 sowie die ebenfalls am Mittwoch vorgestellte zweite Version der Computer-Uhr Apple Watch sind die Geräte, mit denen der Konzern gegen die stärker gewordene Konkurrenz antritt.
Äußerlich sieht das iPhone 7 weitgehend wie die bisherigen Modelle der 6er-Reihe aus. Aber unter anderem Kamera und Display wurden deutlich verbessert. Das größere iPhone 7 Plus bekam eine zweite Linse für optischen Zoom und Tiefenschärfe-Effekte. Der neue Chip "A10 Fusion" sei doppelt so schnell wie der im zwei Jahre alten iPhone 6. Der Speicher in der günstigsten Variante wurde von 16 auf 32 Gigabyte angehoben. Die Preise in Deutschland beginnen bei 759 Euro, ausgeliefert wird ab dem 16. September.
Übertragung per Bluetooth
Die Ohrhörer wird man beim iPhone 7 über Apples hauseigenen digitalen "Lightning"-Anschluss einstöpseln oder drahtlos per Bluetooth verbinden können. Ein Grund für den Schritt sei, dass der Platz im Inneren der immer dünneren Telefone sehr kostbar werde, sagte Apple-Manager Phil Schiller bei der Vorstellung des Geräts in San Francisco.
Die Abschaffung der traditionellen 3,5-Millimeter-Ohrhörer-Buchse war schon nach Gerüchten im Vorfeld der Präsentation zum Teil als "verbraucherfeindlich" kritisiert worden. Für Nutzer von Kopfhörern mit klassischen Klinkensteckern wird ein Adapter beigelegt, den es für neun Euro auch einzeln zu kaufen gibt. Zudem stellte Apple eigene Bluetooth-Ohrhörer vor, die komplett ohne Kabel auskommen. diese "AirPods" werden in Deutschland 179 Euro kosten. dpa

New iPhone 7 ditches the headphone socket

The headphone socket has been a mainstay of portable music players since the days of the Walkman, with its roots in the telephone exchanges of the late 19th century.
However, its days could be numbered. Last night in San Francisco, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7, the first iPhone without a headphone socket.
The 3.5mm socket has featured on every iPhone since Steve Jobs launched the first one in 2007. Since then, Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the smartphones.
When Apple does something radical, other companies tend to follow. Philip Schiller, the Apple executive in charge of marketing, said that the company decided to scrap the headphone jack because it had "the courage to move on".
The iPhone 7 is to be sold with EarPods, Apple's standard earphones, which will now connect to the device through its charging port. Apple AirPods, the company's new noise-cancelling wireless earphones, will be sold separately, for £159. They last for five hours on a single charge and can be recharged in their carrying case.
Apple will, however, appease the Luddites by including an adapter that plugs in to the iPhone 7's charging port to create a standard 3.5mm headphone socket.
The iPhone 7, with a 4.7in screen, and the iPhone 7 Plus, with a 5.5in screen, will be available in the UK from September 16. The cheapest model will cost £599. The new smartphones look like sleeker versions of their predecessors, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. They come in black, silver, gold and rose gold, as well as a new high-gloss jet black finish. Sir Jony Ive, chief design officer, said that the new phones represented "the most deliberate evolution of our founding design".
The 12-megapixel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus has a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens. The single camera on the iPhone 7 features an optical image stabiliser to prevent blurring from shaking hands and a high-speed sensor for taking action shots, a lens that lets in 50 per cent more light and a more powerful flash.
In addition, the new models feature longer battery life, louder speakers, faster processors and graphics chips and both will be water resistant.
Both the iPhone 7 devices come with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of storage, the latter being double the amount of storage available in the original iPhone 6 series.Key featuresAirPods Headphone jack scrapped; wireless headphones are sold separately for £159.Dual-lens camera Images are stitched together to create a photograph nearing the quality of a professional SLR camera.Battery life Two hours longer than iPhone 6.

New iPhone aims to cut cord for audio

SAN FRANCISCO - Apple's latest iPhone might be more notable for what's missing than what's been added, as the consumer tech giant tries to revive demand for its top-selling product and nudge consumers closer to its vision of a wireless world.
That's a world where, in Apple's view, consumers will use the same wireless ear buds to shift seamlessly from listening to music on their iPhone to talking with their Apple Watch and other gadgets made by the California tech giant.
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus unveiled Wednesday come with a faster processor, longer battery life and better cameras - including a new dual lens system in the pricier 7 Plus model that provides higher quality zooming. But the new phones won't have the analog headphone jack that's been a staple for decades in just about every consumer electronics device that can play audio.
Apple is betting its legions of loyal fans will embrace the shift to digital headsets that use wireless connections. Or - if they insist on sticking with their old ways - that they won't mind using a new style of earbuds that plug into the iPhone's "Lightning" charging port.
The redesigned earbuds - with cord - will be included with the new iPhones. Also in the box: an adapter that will let older headphones plug into the digital charging port. But Apple would clearly prefer to push consumers to make the leap into what it envisions as a "wireless future."
"The reason to move on is courage," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, who spoke during the company's fall product event. "The courage to move on and do something new that will benefit all of us."
As part of the transition, Apple also is introducing wireless "AirPods" that sell for $160. They're powered by an Apple- designed processor and special software that Schiller said will let users easily sync the wireless buds to their iPhone, Apple Watch and other Apple devices. Apple also is promising a new line of high-end wireless speakers from its Beats division.
Getting rid of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack helped Apple make room for a second iPhone speaker designed for playing stereo sound.
The iPhone 7 is also water resistant, a popular feature that rivals such as Samsung Electronics have introduced in some phones.
Schiller portrayed the move to drop the headphone jack as a step toward improving user experience. "It makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices," he said during the company's annual fall event.
Apple has previously reduced the number of ports in its popular line of MacBook computers, while encouraging people to use wireless services for transferring files and streaming data.

StarKist sees Charlie as a good candidate
North Shore-based food company StarKist plans to take advantage of the nation's election obsession over the next several weeks by putting up Charlie the Tuna as a candidate. In a marketing campaign labeling the mascot as the "altunative candidate," StarKist, a subsidiary of South Korean company the Dongwon Group, is going with the tagline, "Changing America one tasty meal at a time." The company said there is more to come on his "experience, qualifications, platform and viewpoints." No word on whether his long form birth certificate will be made available.

Oreo chocolate bars key to Mondelez's U.S. plan
Moving on from Hershey's rejection of its recent overtures, Oreo-maker Mondelez International announced its plan B to expand into the U.S. chocolate market: Oreo chocolate bars. Mondelez executives announced the move at the Barclays 2016 Consumer Staples Conference. The global snacking and confectionery company, headquartered in Chicago, will begin selling Oreo-branded chocolate bars made with the company's Milka chocolate; it also will sell a new line of premium chocolate bars under its Green & Black's brand. Last week, Mondelez announced it was ending its efforts to acquire Hershey, the dominant chocolate-maker in the U.S.
Mich. moves forward with autonomous vehicle tests
The Michigan Senate on Wednesday unanimously passed a package of four bills aimed at making the state a research center for the testing of autonomous vehicles. Some of the bills could protect automakers from ride-hailing competition from companies such as Google, Apple and other technology developers, said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who has studied the legal impact of self-driving cars. Two of the bills expressly authorize "on-demand automated motor vehicle networks" that involve a recognized motor vehicle manufacturer in some capacity. The bills approve testing of the new technology on 122 miles of roads in the state.
Fed report shows growth weakened slightly
The economy grew at a moderate or modest pace this summer in eight of the Federal Reserve's 12 U.S. districts, a slowdown from previous reports that may make Fed policymakers more cautious about an interest rate hike. The Fed's "Beige Book" survey of business conditions, released Wednesday, found that growth weakened in two districts - Philadelphia and Richmond. The economy was unchanged in New York and Kansas City. In its last report in July, growth was modest or moderate in 11 of 12 districts.

Apple recently held a keynote address in San Francisco on Sept. 7 to unveil the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Airpods, Apple's latest attempt at pushing wireless headphones.
It seemed as if this event gave us everything that Apple fans, like myself, have been asking for for years: a water resistant iPhone, built in GPS on the Apple Watch, and wireless headphones designed by Apple.
Everything that graced that Bill Graham Civic Auditorium stage had been speculated about for months. It's what didn't get much stage time that caught my attention.
Apple, who prides itself on being inclusive and diverse, had only three women address the excited crowd (and even less people of color). According to Mic, this attributes to about 7% of the speaking time for women during the keynote.
Of the 19 executives at the top of Apple's leadership, only three are women. Two women serve on Apple's eight-member board of directors.
Why is this I often wonder? Given the fact that women largely outnumber men in college and account for roughly 60% of bachelor's degree holders in the United States, according to Fortune Magazine.
The answer may lie the good old-fashioned stereotype that 'boys are better at science and math than girls' and the lack of encouragement that girls receive in pursuing STEM careers from those around them.
Whatever the case may be, gender diverse companies, not only look better, but their teams have greater creativity and make better decisions, according to researchers at the University of Castilla la Mancha, Spain. Companies with the highest female representation outperformed competing companies by 42%.
Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg, author of "Lean In" said, "No industry or country can reach its full potential until women reach their full potential. This is especially true of science and technology, where women with a surplus of talent still face a deficit of opportunity."
Apple understands this need to grow more diverse and they have made efforts to improve this. Their global female team has increased from 31% to 37% since 2014.
I believe the world will benefit when all ideas are valued and everyone has a seat at the table.

"Check it out guys, people are shopping for Apple products during Puja," one of a group of four men who had marched into Quest mall on Sashthi evening for clothes and grub said. "No, no... today's iPhone 7 launch," said another.
"What???" said the man who had started the conversation. Their eyes were on the 100-odd people who had queued up outside Imagine. Metro was present in the mall and at M-Touch on Elgin Road when the clock struck seven and the doors of the stores opened to applause and people rushed in. None stopped to look at other Apple products at Imagine. It was a dash for the billing desk. "Apple is Apple. We have been booking iPhone 7 for days now. The only standard we compete with is the standard set by us. So, we are competing with ourselves and not with any other company," 

Ankit Chordia, tech commercial head of Imagine, said. He also had to deal with customers visiting his three other Imagine stores across the city

Samsung Galaxy S8: Release date revealed, price, design and features; The highly-anticipated phone could be unveiled in February -  here's everything we know so far

Samsung's Galaxy S8 could be launched next month and gadget fans are eagerly awaiting its release.
When it does arrive it could be available in two different sizes - although there's discrepancies amongst tech sites about whether there will be an edge version.
Samsung is pinning high hopes on the S8 after the disastrous recall of the Galaxy Note 7 last year.
A number of handsets exploded and in total the recall reportedly cost the company £4.3 billion.
The Korean tech giant is keeping tight-lipped about its new instalment - the S8 - but here's a round-up of the latest rumours and design overhauls currently online.
According to tech websitesammobile.comthe Galaxy S8 will launch on Saturday, April 15 at an event in New York.
However, since 2011 Samsung Galaxy phones have been announced at, or around the time of, the Mobile World Congress tradeshow in Barcelona, Spain. This year the event will be held from Monday, February 27 to Friday, March 2.
But if claims of a later launch date are true the S8 will be unveiled more than one month after the show.
Taking all this into consideration it's unlikely we'll see the phone on our shelves before March 2017.
The Galaxy S7 Edge 32GB RRP is £639 and the Galaxy S7 32GB RRP is £569.
Bearing this in mind, it's unlikely Samsung will deviate too far from this kind of pricing, so you better start saving.
One of the major design overhauls could see Samsung completely change the front of the phone, creating a touchscreen device without any physical buttons. Does this mean the end of the home button?
There's also rumours that if there's an edge version it will have a curved screen, much like the S7 and S6 models.
According to gadget websiteFone ArenaSamsung is reportedly planning to include a pair of stereo speakers on the forthcoming phone.
They wrote: "According to our sources this dual speaker technology will have a branding, like the HTC's Boomsound. It could also come with HARMAN branding, and powered by technology from HARMAN that it recently agreed to acquire for about $8.0 billion".
Pressure sensitive screen
The phone could feature a pressure sensitive screen - a feature Apple adopted in 2015 and can be seen on the iPhone 6S, the original Apple Watch and several MacBooks.
But it's difficult to tell if anything concrete will come of this rumour. Fans had the same hopes for the S7 but it didn't end up happening.
Water and dust resistant
The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are both waterproof and dustproof so it only makes sense Samsung will carry this feature on to the next model.
Eye sensing technology
The eye scanner in the Galaxy S7 and the S7 edge is expected to be improved for the S8, taking less time to register and being more user responsive.
Headphone jack
It's believed Samsung is planning to follow in the footsteps of Apple and ditch the headphone jack, instead launching a pair of lightweight Bluetooth earphones - similar to Apple's AirPods.
Samsung already has wireless earbuds called Gear IconX which can store up to 1, 000 songs, they also include a small touchpad to control music playback.

Save my battery, Apple, not the world

In the 1930s, an Israeli psychiatrist identified a malady he called Jerusalem syndrome. Previously normal people would arrive at the Holy City and be seized by messianic zeal. Looking at many American tech companies today, it's hard not to diagnose something similar in their boardrooms. For some, it's not enough to boast of running a successful business: their mission is nothing less than to change the world.
Symptoms of Silicon Valley syndrome were clearly on show at last week's iPhone 7 launch. Over two interminable hours, a series of senior Apple executives stood up in a 7,000-seat auditorium in San Francisco to announce updates to the iPhone and Apple Watch with all the majesty and gravity of Moses delivering the stone tablets.
While watching the video live stream of the event, I caught myself thinking, you don't get dishwasher manufacturers carrying on like this, do you? Yet the tech industry is suffused with the belief that it is moulding www.humanity.No wonder obeying national laws or paying taxes feels such an imposition.
At one point, there were three references to changing the world within five minutes. At another, we were invited to look at a picture of a Chinese yak farm.
The highlight was when Philip Schiller, senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, announced the rationale behind dropping the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7. Until now, the 3.5mm jack has been a universal industry standard: one pair of headphones worked with everything from oldfashioned record players to new www.PCs.No longer. The new iPhone's headphones will plug into the same rectangular socket as the charging cable. To use both at once, or to use normal 3.5mm headphones, you'll need an adaptor.
This is either a necessary innovation to free up space inside the phone for a better camera, or a cynical attempt to lock customers into buying Apple's own-brand headphones. Even the former explanation was not epic enough for Schiller, though.
"Some people have asked why we would remove the analogue headphone jack from the iPhone," he told the crowd. "It really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on, do something new, that betters all of us." Doesn't that bring a tear to your eye? Pack up your polio vaccine, lads. Cancel the space programme. Put a sock in it, Malala. Here is the true triumph of the human spirit.
What's worse is that there is no need for this sort of pomposity. Apple is a clever, successful, innovative company. It challenged the dominance of Microsoft. With the iPad, it invented a new genre of device. And if you've ever seen a toddler tapping fruitlessly at an old-fashioned television, you will appreciate how quickly its touchscreen technology has become part of our daily lives.
In the past decade, however, Apple has gone from an easy company to love to a hard one to like. It has become the Keith Vaz of tech firms: so insufferable that many would cheer its downfall.
The fault lies with a Silicon Valley ideology that insists on "disruption" as its highest goal. Not only must traditional industries be disrupted - as Uber claims to have done with taxis, and Airbnb with hotels - but companies must continually reinvent themselves. It doesn't matter that Apple is sitting on cash reserves of more than $200bn (£150bn); any company that makes only minor improvements to excellent existing products might as well give up.
And so Apple knew it could not just announce the thoughtful tweaks it has made to the iPhone camera. Instead, it had to unveil "AirPods" - wireless headphones. Their battery lasts five hours and only a brave soul would shove them into a bag or a pocket; instead they must nestle in a special protective case, which doubles as a charger. Oh, and they cost $159. That's the price of disruption for you.
Personally, none of this impresses as much as an iPhone battery that lasts past 5pm would do. If Apple could give me that, I'd sit through all the pictures of yak farms its executives could throw at me.

The declining popularity of iPhones highlights challenges that Apple is facing in China, which was once the company's biggest growth engine but has recently become a source of disappointment.

Wang Wanli, a 26-year-old sales manager in Beijing, has been thinking about upgrading his iPhone 6, which he bought two years ago. To his disappointment, however, Apple's latest product rollout on Thursday morning fell short of his expectations.
He said he had found no big improvement on the iPhone 7, which Apple is banking on to regain the market share in China that it is losing to domestic players.
For example, he is comfortable with Apple's operating system, but he said he thought "the iPhone 7 does not look as cool as the Lenovo Moto Z modular handset".
Wang is not alone. As Chinese smartphone vendors such as Huawei and Oppo scramble to offer cheaper alternatives with competitive functions, experts say local consumers are less willing to wait in long lines for a new iPhone.
The iPhone 7 will be available in China on Sept 16, although online ordering begins on Friday. Jin Di, research manager at International Data Corp China, said iPhone 7's routine upgrades on cameras and processors show that hard-ware is no longer Apple's edge.
"The sales of iPhone 7 will be worse than the iPhone 6, which once took China by storm," Jin said.
The declining popularity of iPhones highlights challenges that Apple is facing in China, which was once the company's biggest growth engine but has recently become a source of disappointment.
In the quarter ended in June, Apple saw a 33 percent drop in sales in China, marking its highest decline in all regions, while domestic brands Huawei and Oppo saw surges in shipments of 15 per-cent and 124 percent, respectively.
Huawei said earlier this month that it had sold 4.5 million units of P9 by July, its premium-end smartphone that includes dual cameras and sells for 3,688 yuan ($550). In comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus with similar features starts at 6,388 yuan.
"It will be hard for Apple to regain the crown in China with the iPhone 7 series, given the declining enthusiasm among consumers," said Nicole Peng, research director at Shanghai-based consultancy Canalys.
Canalys forecasts that Apple will see a 12 percent year-on-year decline in smartphone shipments to China this year.
According to Peng, Apple still dominates the above-3,000 yuan handset market, where most consumers remain loyal to the brand.
"But that consumer group is growing very, very slowly. And Apple's growth, in fact, needs to be driven by potential consumers who usually buy smartphones priced from 2,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Now, however, such potential consumers have all chosen local vendors," Peng added.

Apple has unveiled the new iPhone 7 , having made the phone water resistant for the first time and removed the headphone jack.
The tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook announced the phone at an event in San Francisco, though a social media glitch saw the firm's Twitter account - only recently activated - accidentally reveal the news early.
A new version of the Apple Watch, called the Series 2 and with greater focus on health and exercise tracking, was also announced, including a special Nike+ version for runners.
The Watch, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go on sale on September 16, with pre-orders for the devices beginning on Friday.
Instead of the traditional headphone connection, iPhone packages will now come with earphones that fit into the phone's Lighting port, currently used for charging and data transfer.
However, Apple also revealed new wireless earphones, called AirPods, that will connect to both iPhone and Apple Watch remotely.
An adaptor that enables traditional headphones to continue to plug into the iPhone will also be included in the box.
The iPhone 7 has also had its camera completely redesigned, with a much-rumoured second lens being added to the larger iPhone 7 Plus that will enable users to capture more zoomed images without losing picture quality.
The lenses across the two phones now contain a 12 megapixel sensor.
Mr Cook said of the smartphone: "It has become the industry gold standard.
"iPhone is the phone by which all others are measured and it has become a cultural phenomenon."
In July, the tech giant revealed it had sold the one billionth unit of the device, while Mr Cook said the Apple Watch was now the world's second most popular watch brand and most popular smartwatch.

Tempting Apple out of reach
iPhone raises barriers as billions seek to connect
IT IS that time of the year when the big tech companies launch new toys to tempt consumers to spend and upgrade ahead of the festive season.
Apple's fancy new iPhone 7 was the most keenly awaited of the new toys and the launch this week received a bit of an unexpected boost from the woes of rival Samsung, which is recalling more than 2.5-million of its new Galaxy Note 7 phones after a battery fault caused hundreds of them to catch fire and explode.
Apple didn't invent smartphones. But it has certainly been a leader in advancing the aesthetics and the technology of the smartphone since the first Apple phone was launched more than a decade ago. It continues to stretch the boundaries and has done so again with the iPhone 7, which will ship in the US next week and in SA probably only in October.
The new model reportedly looks much like the iPhone 6 but has some new and covetable features, such as a dual-lens camera, which promises to take even better pictures, improved battery life and water resistance.
The big difference is that Apple has scrapped the headphone jack. The decision has already generated huge controversy in the market, prompting outrage and puzzlement on social media.
But the headphone jack issue is a more profound one that goes to the heart of how Apple operates - and that is either a fatal flaw or a huge competitive advantage, depending on one's perspective.
Older phones have a jack into which users plug headphones to listen to their music or calls without sharing the experience. iPhone 7 users will have to use wireless devices instead. Innovative no doubt, but they are designed to work with Apple's own $159 AirPods.
This is typical of Apple, with its fixation on making sure its devices rely on its own software and its own Apple-branded accessories. This supposedly guarantees the quality of the experience and the reliability of the products. It also guarantees that they are costly and that the barriers to entry are high.
Investors, of course, will like the headphone thing, because selling accessories generates lots of revenue, and Apple needs the revenue boost. Sales of its Apple watch have fallen and so have those of its mobile phones lately.
But it is more controversial with consumers. And the barriers to entry that Apple erects are particularly unpopular with developers everywhere.
That raises interesting questions about the Apple model, particularly in developing countries. Smartphones are playing an ever more important role in expanding access to billions of poor people in developing countries, connecting them to job opportunities and to a wider world of information and knowledge, not just to their friends and relations (although that is important, too).
In SA, with its estimated 23-million smartphones, more than 80% of those who access the internet use smartphones to do so. There are similar trends elsewhere in Africa, with smartphones driving the expansion of mobile financial services and other services.
Smartphones are being used by health-care workers in deep rural areas in developing countries to access medical records and connect to diagnostic information so they can provide services that poor people would otherwise not be able to access. And that's just in healthcare.
Developers are finding innovative social applications for the devices, with their ability to take and send photos or capture and check fingerprints or access the web. Costly devices would not be the first choice, surely, for providing services to the poor. And the developers are likely to prefer open-source software, rather than having to customise programs for Apple devices.
That surely limits Apple's role in development. But its toys are as innovative, and as covetable, as ever.
It has certainly been a leader in advancing the aesthetics and the technology of the smartphone since the first Apple phone

Tim Cook and James Corden's Carpool Karaoke: dissecting an awkward ride; The journey to Wednesday's Apple event raises important questions: was the OneRepublic song really about Steve Jobs? And why Sweet Home Alabama?

The Apple event that saw the unveiling of the iPhone 7 and AirPods opened with a short film of CEO Tim Cook in a Carpool Karaoke session with Late Late Show host James Corden. It was just about as awkward as it sounds.
The video of Corden escorting Cook to the event in San Francisco, opens with the pair belting OneRepublic's I Lived, which includes the lyric: "Hope when the crowd screams out, they're screaming your name." 
 Related:  James Corden's Carpool Karaoke to debut as series on Apple Music
Not to read too much into the choice, but is it a stretch to imagine this particular sentiment resonating with Cook, who is not and never will be Steve Jobs? I mean, he's literally about to take the stage at an Apple product launch, and just last year there was an entire film dedicated to scenes of crowds rapturously greeting Steve Jobs as he took the stage at product launches.
After the pair engage in some banter and messing about with Siri, the singer-songwriter-producer Pharrell Williams hops into the backseat, and the trio break into Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1974 hit Sweet Home Alabama. 
Cook hails from Mobile, Alabama, which might explain the song choice - or could there be another element at work here? Lynyrd Skynrd wrote the song as a something between a response to and attack on Neil Young, who in recent years has become more and more devoted to the development of the Pono, a portable digital media and music player that Young would very much like you to believe is a competitor to Apple's various products. Is Cook throwing shade?
The video is the most fun you'll have watching an ageing CEO strain to appear good-natured all day, assuming that the remainder of your day doesn't somehow involve finding yourself in Elon Musk's office as he realizes that someone has moved the blotter on his desk a quarter-inch to the left.

Trouble in the Aer for DAA amid Apple trademark row

DAA, the company that runs Dublin airport, has been forced to amend a trademark application for its new digital advertising screens, following a complaint from Apple that the name is too similar to its new wireless AirPod headphones.
Earlier this year DAA applied for a trademark for the phrase AerPod, a series of 62 digital-advertising screens in Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, which it describes as state of the art.
The 70in screens are already operating 24 hours a day in the airport.
In April, a Delaware-registered company, Entertainment in Flight LLC, lodged a formal opposition to DAA's application, claiming it had already secured a European trademark for the phrase AirPod.
The challenge, lodged by Dublin solicitor LK Shields, claimed the DAA's trademark was "too similar" to its own and had been registered for similar services, including digital screens. The American company said that this could create a "likelihood of confusion" between the two trademarks.
At the time it was not clear that Entertainment in Flight had any link to Apple or that the technology company's proposed headphones were to be called AirPods. The DAA, which was unaware it was dealing with Apple, declined to comment this weekend but a note on its trademark application indicates it was amended last month to remove a reference to digital screens. Apple also declined to comment.
Last week it became clear that Entertainment in Flight was a front company for Apple, which frequently uses dummy names to register trademarks and patent technology. Late last year MacRumors, a blog about Apple's operations, speculated that Entertainment in Flight was being used by Apple to "camouflage its trademark work", since its only operations were to file trademarks similar to existing Apple phrases. AirPod, they noted, was similar to EarPod, the name used by Apple for its former headphones.
Last week's confirmation that the Apple iPhone 7 would not have a headphone jack had been predicted, but still overshadowed the launch of the new device. The new AirPod earphones work on bluetooth technology and have been priced by Apple at $159 ((EURO)142). They will deliver a "magical experience", Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice-president, claimed at the product's launch. @colincoyle

Why Apple ditched the headphone jack, and why some are miffed; This week Apple announced that the new iPhone 7 and 7 plus, the newest models in their successful series of smartphones, will no longer include a headphone jack.

Apple is no stranger to big or controversial announcements. In 2001 the company, then headed by visionary leader Steve Jobs, made history by announcing the first generation of iPods, thus revolutionizing the portable music industry and initiating a transformation of the way we think about music as a whole.
In this week's keynote address, marketing chief Phil Schiller announced that from now on, new versions of Apple's popular iPhone and iPhone plus smartphones will not include a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack - once again making Apple the first company to abandon a long-standing tradition.
"The reason to move on: courage. The courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us," Mr. Schiller said onstage in his Wednesday address.
That "something new" is part of Apple's new push to market their own line of Bluetooth wireless accessories, as well as those made by Beats by Dre - a high-end headphone manufacturer founded by hip-hop mogul Dr. Dre and acquired by Apple in 2014. All Apple and Beats products will now feature the new W1 chip designed by Apple to cohesively interact with all current Apple products both via bluetooth as well as utilizing Apple's cloud-based iCloud sharing program.
The earpieces are integrated with Siri, Apple's artificial intelligence system, and are designed to simplify everyday functions like making calls and receiving information on an Apple Watch.
"It's not just about your iPhone anymore," says mobile tech analyst Carolina Milanese of Creative Strategies. "It's about getting consumers thinking more about that ecosystem of Apple products and how they all play nicely together."
Ms. Milanese sees a greater overarching goal in streamlining Apple connectivity: reversing Apple's recent decline in sales.
While the removal of a headphone jack may feel like an unlikely way to strengthen that ecosystem, analyst Julie Ask of Forrester Research points out, "Apple has a very long history of removing features we all thought were necessary, and then convincing us that we didn't need them."
She points to the way Apple led the industry in moving away from floppy discs and optical drives in computers. "Three months later, it will be, 'Why did we ever have that?' "
The earliest versions of in-ear headphones were designed as telephone receivers and were invented and patented in 1891 by French engineer Ernest Jules Pierre Mercadier, as The Washington Post notes. But in 1910, Nathaniel Baldwin, an electrical engineer and Mormon fundamentalist, developed modern-style headphones in his kitchen, which the US Navy purchased for their dramatically improved sound quality. 
In 1979 Sony introduced the Walkman stereo, a portable tape player that launched the first widespread use of the 3.5-mm headphone jack. In 2001, when Apple introduced the iPod, it came standard with the now-iconic set of white plastic earbuds. By the 2012 debut of the iPhone 5, Apple claimed to have shipped 600 million pairs of those earbuds worldwide.
Now Apple is removing the headphone port altogether.
Critics are already piling on. In an article for Yahoo Finance, Ethan Wolff-Mann describes the decision as "spitting on history." Describing the incredible variety of connectivity options, he views the headphone jack as "a rare example of completely mature technology."
Apple's Mr. Schiller disagrees, deriding the single-use port as an "ancient" technology. The new phones will come with an external headphone jack which can be plugged into the iPhone's multi-use Lightning port, but Shiller says Apple sees the future of mobile sound being dominated by innovative wireless technology - such as their new W1 chip, embedded in their new Airpods and the new line of Beats by Dre headphones.
"We've got this 50-year-old connector - just a hole filled with air - and it's just sitting there taking up space, really valuable space," Apple hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio told BuzzFeed News. "It was holding us back from a number of things we wanted to put into the iPhone. It was fighting for space with camera technologies and processors and battery life. And frankly, when there's a better, modern solution available, it's crazy to keep it around."
Many Apple customers disagree, however. As of Thursday morning, more than 300,000 people had signed a petition asking Apple to keep the headphone jack, citing concerns around increases in consumer costs and electronic waste disposal.
"Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones, it will singlehandedly create mountains of electronic waste - that likely won't get recycled," the petition reads.
Despite consumer resistance, it may be just a matter of time before the tech world ditches wires entirely, as numerous other companies are already pushing toward a wire-free world.
When Nikolaj Hviid, the chief executive officer of German wireless earbud company Bragi, announced his company's partnership with IBM's artificial intelligence interface, he described how users would be able to give and receive instantly translated instructions in multiple languages, monitor vital signs, and help first responders communicate more effectively.
"This is not about making headphones," Mr Hviid said, as quoted in Fortune. "It's about taking the user interface from your eyes and hand and having a much more discreet one when needed. It's part of a bigger puzzle."

Wireless headphone sales soar as iPhone 7 ditches the socket

SALES of wireless headphones are soaring after Apple revealed that the latest version of the iPhone will not have a traditional socket for the first time.
John Lewis reported a 60 per cent sales surge week on week, a trend that is expected to be accelerated by the design of the iPhone 7. Katrina Mills, a buyer for the retailer, said: "Last night's announcement will drive the biggest sales in wireless headphones yet. Ahead of the news we had already seen an increased demand for wireless headphones." Almost six out of 10 of all headphone sales at John Lewis are now wireless models, compared with 21 per cent last year. Apple chief executive Tim Cook revealed in San Francisco last night that the 3.5mm headphone jack had been scrapped to make room for other innovations.
Apple's chief design officer Sir Jonathan Ive said: "We're just at the beginning of a truly wireless future we've been working towards for many years." The handsets will, however, be sold with a headphone adaptor that plugs into the lightning port used to charge the phones.

Wireless headphone sales soar as iPhone7 ditches the socket

SALES of wireless headphones are soaring after Apple revealed that the latest version of the iPhone will not have a traditional socket for the first time.
John Lewis reported a 60 per cent sales surge week on week, a trend that is expected to be accelerated by the design of the iPhone7. Katrina Mills, a buyer for the retailer, said: "Last night's announcement will drive the biggest sales in wireless headphones yet. Ahead of the news we had already seen an increased demand for wireless headphones."
Almost six out of 10 of all headphone sales at John Lewis are now wireless models, compared with 21 per cent last year. Apple chief executive Tim Cook revealed in San Francisco last night that the 3.5mm headphone jack had been scrapped to make room for other innovations.
Apple's chief design officer Sir Jonathan Ive said: "We're just at the beginning of a truly wireless future we've been working towards for many years." The handsets, however, will be sold with a headphone adaptor that plugs into the lightning port used to charge the phones.

iPhone users fight headphone switch

As rumours persist that this year's iPhone 7 will arrive without the standard 3.5mm headphone jack, hundreds of thousands of people have expressed their opposition to the idea by signing an online petition titled "Apple is ditching the standard headphone jack to screw consumers and the planet".
At the time of writing, the petition at sumofus.org has attracted more than 241,000 signatories, close to a seemingly arbitrary stated goal of 250,000.
The rumours, which began circulating late last year, indicate the new iPhone will ditch the jack and require headphones to be connected via Bluetooth or via the phone's Lightning port.
Although current iPhones already support both of these options, the trusty old 3.5mm jack is used the most.
So the main concern of this petition is that losing the jack would make many currently existing earphones, headsets and accessories useless.
It may be an understandable concern, but the petition does have flaws in its logic.
First of all, while none of this has been confirmed by Apple, the American company would have done its homework and is unlikely to have its mind changed by a bunch of random users.
More importantly, buying an iPhone 7 is not mandatory. Regardless of its eventual features, nothing bad will happen to those using a different phone after the iPhone 7 is released.
If having a phone with an old headphone jack is very important to someone, they can rest assured there will be many options available for a long time.
Then there's the secondary stated intention of the petition: that Apple should be held to account for creating a pile of e-waste by forcing users to throw away their old headphones.
Surely a much more effective way for the signatories of this petition to minimise e-waste would be to not commit themselves to buying every new iPhone.
All that aside, for anyone who is wringing their hands thinking about a brand new phone having brand new things, instead of the comfortable old things they're used to, there's still good news.
Those who like to use the white earpods that come with the iPhone can rest assured the pair that come with the iPhone 7 will work with whatever interfaces that phone has.
In fact, respected leak reporter Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac reports that Apple and Beats are working on official Bluetooth pods called "AirPods", which will be sold separately as a premium option.
They probably couldn't last longer than a couple of hours, but an innovative charging solution (Gurman suggests a carry bag that charges the pods) could help.
Meanwhile, audiophiles who buy expensive, good quality headphones ought to be celebrating the potential demise of the iPhone's headphone jack.
Since the decades-old 3.5mm standard is an analogue technology and the Lightning port is digital, the change will allow better quality audio.
Yes, you will need an adapter, but the next pair of headphones you buy could be capable of receiving lossless high-resolution audio from your iPhone, or powering advanced noise cancellation without the need for batteries or a bulky design.
The cynical will see the potential dropping of the 3.5mm headphone port as part of an evil ploy to make them buy more headphones and cables but, the fact is, moving to an all-digital audio ecosystem would have real benefits in the long term.
In the worst case, iPhone users will be inconvenienced briefly in the transition between their current headphones and their next set.
Those who think that's too high a price to pay might have to go with a different phone.
